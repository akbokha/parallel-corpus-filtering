<seg id="1">Translate the module website into the & konqueror; translate the menu under Extras address. select the original and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated instead of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated at the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains several modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; choose settings extensions.... Open the card menu Tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setup modules from the kde; addons package. please note that even more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; click on optional crashes. then you can view the page, which has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View Filters module (also called folder filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Angle filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. by default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentItem, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a file or folder specifies the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for easy detecting the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for displaying or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (where, consequently, display errors may occur due to limitations when displaying the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. parameters are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and those boxes need space, which is no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always possible to divide areas so that rectangles emerge that are as square as possible. the best methods in this are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally represented area for an entry on the View menu item View Editor. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget that was developed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery module can be found in & konqueror; menu under Extras Image Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens, allowing you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option Pictures per line has a slider and a rotation panel to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box filename of the image, specify whether the file names will be shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To view the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is shown under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, specify whether the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="31">When saving files in HTML, specify where the HTML page is to be stored.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set up with a slider or a rotary field, up to what level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "copy original images to" "" "" "" "Copy the original images" "" "" "" "to the gallery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">The comment section of the comments box can be used to specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own colour depth, you can set a different depth of colour for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; -settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -settings can be found in & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; view the navigation area under the window or with the F9 key symbol.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror's navigation area; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; add browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page denied access to this browser, change browser recognition to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the ID in MSIE for pages that refuse access to browsers based on Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digiplug; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE's Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitis; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, they should report problems and possibilities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digicam; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu provides a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitis; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions of other users. however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get started & digicam; registration is in the developer mailing list. instructions for logout in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digiplug; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicam; will also use as an alert library. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders. & digikam; looks at any subfolder as an album. no picture will be altered.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; cuts recursively the library path in its entire depth. you can't exclude any subfolders unless it iste in hidden folder. this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change the ones by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digicam; your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, then & digikam; possibly also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help RohkameraBackup.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and any card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive unit. the camera then appears via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digicam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions are slow over the serial port, this connection has become obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the preview images of digiKam can be read reliably. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see preview images or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about digitis; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modulating modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complement one function when the changes in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sills with & LMB, or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping of images works everywhere: you can place an image in a different part of the alb tree, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter will only work on the filename only if it is displayed in the symbol view. what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy multiple photos in the same way. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to input information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album Collections: are a way to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. selecting from the toolbar or sorting view albums after collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">First try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview list. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicam; supports entering keywords for single photos in the My keywords list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. all photos of the album are always part of the collection. of course you can use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures will be shown in this album in the picture window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait briefly while the preview images are generated. you can avoid using the Tools menu to recreate all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can edit about settings digiplug; choose the albums page and customize the area preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screen shot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about what it was about & digitis; go. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to them. you can reach all the functions that have been edited & digitised. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by right-clicking on either F4... or selecting the right mouse button and editing... selecting. in the editing section you will find instructions on how to edit your photos. with the image editing you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digitis; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the sub-menu of opening. to do this, and how to adjust it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, it can cause problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not save this data when you save the modified image. this is why this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digiline; provides two options for rotation. the simplest one is to click the right mouse button to preview and rotate. in the submenu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you remove a photo from & digikam; delete it, it will be moved to the garbage bin of & kde; F8 Image Delete or def If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Delete.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datamsliderquot; organizes your photos using the data. & digikam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last change of file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or searching.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold up parts of the tree & quot; My keywords listings, so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are saved in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keywords, or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on a new keyword, this keyword will become the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by right-clicking on the keyword and selecting delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking it and selecting keyword editing in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keywords.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the picture with the right mouse button and select as the album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To be able to use keywords, you first have to provide your photos with keyword. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can click them on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keywords. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the previews of the pictures and select keywords from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will appear under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Remove. the menu only shows the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent adjusted histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be shifted using this histogram. to select a time frame, just click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this will display all related images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all database elements: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Beside the search box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search finds matches. if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search did not find anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as shown above. you can search this search here however as live search, which always filtering what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search is executed. the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window. the text box Save Search is used to make your request a name in my search list. if you want to change your selection after searching, you just have to select the appropriate entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit the search, the search form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select to edit as advanced search, the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search. here you find more rules for searching.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters, which you can search for in certain fields of & digiplug; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. an option can be added to this list with Search Group / Delete, or deleted from it. each option can be associated with others through logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... you can create type & quot; AND NICHTquot; create.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitis; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond to each other. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar. by means of a Schwellert the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from somewhere on the icon of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour scheme: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the right pictures. also here, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or zoom out or move it and move it while you drag the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to draw a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo-filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including shell files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the LED from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened. if you are back in & digiplug; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras luminous.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select a preview from the toolbar and perform Zoo or move operations on one of the images, then these are also executed on the other picture. you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison. use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it on the left. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion operations work directly from the illuminated table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to pivot the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; in the preview, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom function works as well as in other views. simply use the zoom regulator under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use your pictures. we focus on the process for digital fotographers that & digikam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, securing, evaluating, previewing, archiving, optimizing, waiting and export of image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Stock Management assumes, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, converts, confuses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not need to find a certain photo without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not use & digikam;. the approach to store metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving to which you can access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you need to incorporate something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files need to be somehow organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you do enough photos, then you will be using subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of things. within 10 years, 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option Metadata to be saved to the file's settings page; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, & digikam, provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to every photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. you start best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at the next work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you often call in other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically create the tree for you or insert the images in the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlap. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let people see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I am telling you this of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream of having associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the importance to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text as you want, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. KDE even provides you a spell check. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will tell you a second time for publishing.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different town without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now moving with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels through images with geographic data.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a copyright and designates the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the direction page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the photographer who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, for example, the name of a company or organization may be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the vendor field to identify who works the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is listed here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not offer protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change this metadata embedded in the image. for private individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failures, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, disseminated superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics what reasons a data loss has.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated cautiously and you may not be trusted for more than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers on gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and store them in the correct way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">Therefore they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a cost-effective program called IsoBuster which appears to work wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual player DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. then read the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for you. your manufacturer warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the troubleshooting mechanisms of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors found by SMART announce the imminent failure. these are especially reading errors and swap meters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices don't matter much, this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, damaged motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as also by this one overvoltage. some manufacturers provide overvoltage drops that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a large number of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also provide protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While a overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power failure occurs. this gives you the opportunity to save your data and run the system in order. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with the cost of avoiding it. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W USV can you consider for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can integrate it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">Solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. therefore, it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS file system and btrfs file system ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undetected until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed for your surprise. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data way than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for Linux; it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. notebooks already account for the share of thefts 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage than for example theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the broadened file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely stored before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even though this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive gets you today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anybody else for data loss. so, 6% of all PCs are often affected by data loss. so, backup your data to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of records, or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means not local storage. bring up your backups to the stairs, to the neighboring house, to your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another benefit of physical separation: as stated above, a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only duplicates the difference of the files that have actually been changed.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC saved in the image file, maintaining associated XMP files, preserving memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is approximately the time period in which you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you must consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to be backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. if you have an old system that is important for reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the print expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability with you and put the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this section and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command to see if your new disk has been recognized by the system, but do not mount it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollars; parted reside / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBI; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sdb; resize2fs / dev / sdb; change the size of reiserfs if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (default). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open frame format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already making DNG available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of application and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard links and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw file. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digikam; edit, then you should add metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them into web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; to get a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use & digiplug your digital camera; connect them to your computer, connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it will try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished -indicator will appear at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. using the page bars features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tabs metadata displays internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as the metadata page strip of the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of all. download the photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the photos were securely downloaded to an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the button selected is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available for download. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download or download the selected albums, select a dialog with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums, sorted as usual folders. select the album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete button. if you want to delete only some, you need to select them first and then delete the selected erase.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore photos deleted from the camera. the photos are not moved to & kde; they are deleted completely. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete the camera file completely, you should do so using the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names. the file names are usually reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can result in double file names if you upload photos of different recording sets to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the picture was made in the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the commit opens three more options which are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in the standard car identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the EXif information are copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, for example, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-%% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the date & time option. for further adjustments you should read the help of the strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase when you download it. or, in capital letters, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which was digitized; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the metadata section metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Auto-rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver that information, it lets & digicode; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the extension button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digitis; this will be used to automatically load sub-albums in the target album when downloading. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually off, and in this case, & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the option Dates-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to their camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digicode; you see where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicam; users who want to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that we have many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitelites and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few working with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsd or gpsbabel. however, you need to store this data in the gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the Excel Tool by Phil Harvey. it uses the character encoded coordinates, which are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; try to give as much control over your work sequences as possible. there are many settings that modify the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to edit the settings menu in the Settings menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to set preview or image processing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. even in case of a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's line: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this may be designations like e.g. employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to give the name that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here since this is the picture other & quot; anbieta quot;.</seg>
<seg id="288">IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC fields. this means that metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded inscriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse pointer is placed in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitis; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the light signal of & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the LED, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG uses a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data needs more time to expand and unpack. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression ratio.</seg>
<seg id="298">This reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you select the lossless setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata has not yet been supported, but found itself in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. at present, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if white balance is not set. standard is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in more detail in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the highlights, so the parts of your images are burned-in, due to the inability of your camera to capture the highlights, as continuous white. use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results, as it shows the highlights in various rose tones. lastly, you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not saturate as quickly as green and red. & nbsp; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstruction option, you will have the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the & digikam. to keep the time for invoicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD Interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softener correction as you are carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how it should be returned. there is also LCMS and & digikam. information such as color information from a color space in the other is to be translated to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC in which you all save your profile.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; standard squot; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your pictures are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not adjust for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated. this could you manually correct instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious what color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with Canon's models. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles which fit together. of course, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a set of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface it can & digikam; many modules written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be edited by & digikam. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the previews.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">For further information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get through the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes activate the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left shows a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Auto detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, place it in the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & digicam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu Cameras by the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog option for moving &gt; images in the trash bin, you can set & digiplug the conversation; when you delete a photo in an album, you will find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly supported by & digikam; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without questions. otherwise, you will need to save the changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also edit & digikam the display of the welcome screen; it may speed up the starting process of & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When starting to search for new photos forces & digikam; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this will extend the start time of & digikam; if something is deleted from the base folder, asked & digikam it; you whether it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digitis; to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings Design. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about it in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; includes fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, please refer to the section Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window displaying file name, current file number, zoom factor and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used file Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you will not be able to recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it by saving file.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or the Restore button Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image processing can be undone or restored. the last action can be reversed by editing and recreating Editing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make use of the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and trace Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB file for a moment longer than the return or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, down the picture, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the selection menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">In order to adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: choose magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you enter the normal view by using the Esc key. normally, you can also edit the toolbar. if you don't want this, you can change this in the & digikam window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences. entire image preview pages can be printed out of your selection. you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select print job from the Album pane Exporting. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a side bar on the right edge, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same page bar is available, without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it will be displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the edge again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a knob More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always performed when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written into the IPTC field Urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with keywords previously used in this & digiplug; -session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can thus quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this feature is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword Search can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all the keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword in the IPTC array.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the Keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, If you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">Suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window shows the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created a rule, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rule area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search on all the elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanners may have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know what buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should allow links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenses are by email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life easy for all, why should one use another color space and thus have to think about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Wybloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to install my monitor if I chose to work exclusively in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to callibrate your monitor, since sRGB assumes that your; onitor is sRGB to sRGB, then you must either allocate your monitor to sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic decoding and contrast extend from the menu Corcorrecting Automatic correction try to automatically make the best out of your colors. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the Leustressing values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparison: this method adjusts the light intensity reactor in the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic decoding: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and bright limit tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a re-image of all values in between. this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is a bit limited since there is a color space with 8 bits per color. if you are too far away from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">The histogram shows a dynamic change as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since, even in well-lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or downgrade the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save these settings, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and allocation of color profiles. colour mapping can be performed through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to adjust your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner will always make the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">The colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a color film optimized in daylight by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can load the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photo. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjusting can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase them. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple Leuchthickness / Contrast / Gamma, the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialogue to this tool works very complicated, you only need the slider field for the application described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, histogram, active channel or selected area. under the graph, three slide gates are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to shift the control and to take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented by a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear histogram is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case, logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brushes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a pale picture as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the screen's input values for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sensible. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode is further helpful.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a shortwave to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">In the preview of the original photos a red marker is to be seen. if you move this mark on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp Curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three pipettes buttons automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of the shade, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo, which was corrected in the luminance channel. shades of shade and sun were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digicam channel mixer; image processing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are on the right side: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will also retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer is the tool to create great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. colour space consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same point in the colour channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color noise first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. you can save any mixer setting for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect shown in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was readjusted. the luminance option is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. in the development of digital photography, black and white is a work step, because color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore like the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">This is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical of the pictures of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 cokin (tm) seepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the engraving of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; Add tool framework can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the confines of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. the image with a colored line, Niepce overrides it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), rounded it with a nice three dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before cutting previously.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into a picture at any place. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. the bigger the image, the bigger the character set must be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you chose for your text can be changed until you click the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; apply tool template you can put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image template menu apply in image processing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the template, simply send an email in english to & digikam, digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you will need to set your stencil folder to the base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the stencils, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder updates the thumbnail of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and easy, but it creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitization process colours combined with minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges becoming blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera has often been applied in internal sharpness. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a follow-up filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening keystroke. you can call it with the menu entry for correcting sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should be careful with this as the results don't work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. generally, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool to soften the image with the menu entry Conducting softener and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount reinforce the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges will produce.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fracture from the maximum RGB value and the applied difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference to apply for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft transition between the tones are excluded from sharper and hence plastic flaws in faces, heavens and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">The original image is the (1) and the image processed (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Detox Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a blur mask. refocusing mostly achieves better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value 1 should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you to reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">This is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the edge. note however that the module will be very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for that purpose. any refocus parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations do not make changes that are not immediately visible, but leave behind unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading and compressing images, eg JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by severely masking a larger neighborhood as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Vienna filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the blur of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows for a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction is one of the most advanced tool for removing unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains several presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film bastion or CCD noise, a high value shaftlike patterns will produce. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooths [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specify how many times the algorithm is going to go through. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles have a long runtime. therefore, you should select this value as greatest and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value less 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by choosing this option is low, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor movie storage during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckel.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow Details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the picture. the area indicated by the radius moves over the picture and the color in it is smoothed and thus fixes smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if it is increased, noise tips are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or blacksmithing occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can't be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the tolerance tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more raucous, but also greens the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of phase jitter damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother if it can be too high.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for the reduction of noise you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction has been applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">The solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than blurring a picture. use tool to soften the image with the menu entry Conducting softeners and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or retrospectively digitised images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm, it creates some compressions & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons storing and loading do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise reduction. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film baskets on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photograph taken with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows the hotpixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-image subtractional method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the button dark image. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in the connection to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and load it again in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image. preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are created in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an intersection of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead & quot; vignettiersiquot; (shaded) they cut the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may cause the necessary shutter time under certain circumstances, which is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blurring effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">It is possible to simulate the effect of a CenterFilter with the wide exposure ranges of today's film and color or gray scale using digital cameras and film scanners. the vignetting grading tool applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or random a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the dation from & digikam. image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction on an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The second degree coefficient shows the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flattens off at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The fourth digits corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values, distortion-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth digits. this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses the 'corners' has the inverted parameter of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thereby results in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjust brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used at the next start as default values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correct spherical correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. it is best to perform this correction first. if you re-trim an image and then perform a tonar-like correction, the effect would be obvious.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transformieren Zutrimming from the Image Processing or via the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects like shots from front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating the infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is reachable under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters to set film baskets and film sensitivity (ISO). turn on the Included Film Correction option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of the film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">As the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digicam; Filming filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your images. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix big silver basins of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-particle effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life. if you want to use this special gallery-like, street-like, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are often required, to ISO 2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-particle effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that processed the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. the lines that outline the outlines in drawing are emphasized. images of whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to sketch out.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraving defines your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">It works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraver filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analog to the wave blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: blurring the image along star-shaped lines emanating from a center point. this simulates the blur of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurring the image by random shifting of pixels and simulating the blur of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the paint tank in the picture and blurring it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the picture into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. thus, it gives your images a wet look. it uses a copyrighted algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the visual effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digitis; image editing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should stay free. when you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentrop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right orientation by mirroring or turning. the tools for this can be found in the Transformation Crafting or Transforming Reflections Menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of picture quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate an image and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to increase an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflating was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Keep aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load Knuckles are used exactly for this purpose. each magnification for photo magnification can be stored as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together an image. to cut a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The clipping button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo will be cut (Ctrl; + X).</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">When cutting the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the transverse format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Trimming After page ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sized photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">If you use the cropping tool for the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the coalight help make it possible to show help, so that you can better assemble your images. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that refers to various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and you have been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden center. a composition that follows this rule is considered visual harmoniously.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center will provide smoother aid lines if you assemble a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this kind.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">Their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not a triangular triangles. diagonals on these lines can be published more dynamical a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can become invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the & digicam; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the knob presets you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the Transformation cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image slightly after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are made around a fixed point of the reference point so called. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is smeared a little. for a single adaptation, this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you will get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction. for example, the upper part of the image is shifted to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can rotate both horizontally and vertically. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture becomes a bit blurred. for a single layer this effect is usually negligible, but two coatings produce twice as much compression and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cropping from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digiplug; shows only files in formats that know. this happens based on file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; the file in image processing will change; you can change this list of file extensions the & digikam; accept. see Configuration section for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. thereby redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour, very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the video converter from & digikam. in the Configuration section you will find further information on the use of modules with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digicam; supports loading of raw images only with the program dcraw, which is included in & digikam. this allows you to see more than 200 raw file formats. all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of shell formats that were edited by & digikam;</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. these clips are often stored in the AVI- or MPEG format. & digikam, but is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built-in feature films to view or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digikam; the & kde; settings to play movies use to start the program to play.</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphic interface with all the features of a well-integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphicviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -dot; -programs are free layout programs. & kgraphicviewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; -program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; recomputes the graph and displays it in & kgraphiviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & posters; open the graph in & kgraphiviewer; open in a billard; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a hack to present more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for displaying graphs. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graph, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphiviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as shown in the lower screen. in this case, the toolbar only opens the symbol file and the (empty) list contains open files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right at pressed & Alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphiviewer; can also note your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item settings kgraphiviewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside of a running & kgraphiviewer; instance, & eg; in the file browser or command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice and change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to one page are to be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one graphene distributed on several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Charge page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or omit the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphiviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside of a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the current session) or determine that every time will be asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of & kgraphiviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBs, opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">It produces hierarchical or layered graphs of oriented graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlapping as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for uncoated graphs. it produces representations according to the spring spring model. it uses the Kamada Kawai algorithm, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a bounce spring model for ungerighted graphs. it uses the fruit-man-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circle according to the description of Six und Tolstoy, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should be able to accept the graphite file as parameter, and the calculated layout of the graphene after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (judged or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for unlit graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is checked, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows the What is the mouse cursor. click on a & GUI element with this mouse pointer; -Element to get more help to this item (if any).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available under this address and in the file ChangeLog in the base folder of the source repository.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; program that uses the & graphviz; tools to display. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraphiviewer; in the Settings menu you will find further options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">Create a new icon. if the current file has been changed, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. then, a dialog appears where you can choose to create the icon from a template, or whether you want to restart from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="763">Restores the last reversal step. if you do not have a step back, this function is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="764">Adds the contents of the clipboard as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="765">Sets the current symbol in gray scales. this can create colors that do not coincide with those of the symbol palette of & kde;</seg>
<seg id="766">Do not change the symbol, but set the current character color to the color of the dot on which you click.</seg>
<seg id="767">The status bar shows you the current actions. from left to right, it shows you the x- and y-coordinates of the current pixel, the size of the current canvas, the magnifying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="768">Adds the contents of the clipboard as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="769">Open with Settings & kiconedit; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for icons, background, and symbol bars.</seg>
<seg id="770">With buttons adding..., editing... and removing, you can change the templates for Standard File, Source File, Compressed File & etc.</seg>
<seg id="771">Select Transparent Pixel or Display rulers and set a color: or a chess board as transparency display. you can also adjust the size of the chess board: the Karos to Klein, Medium and Great as well as the Color 1: and Color 2: select.</seg>
<seg id="772">Reading the KIPI module provides tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the SANE project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you need to have Kooka and SANE installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry image, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears when you can replace the default ducrhe custom to select your image. see the preview and customize the range of your needs before clicking on the scan button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, bottom corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scan button you must wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the image file options appears. please remember that the BMP type is not compressed and therefore very large files. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Saver menu. a window appears where you can set the different screen shot modes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have picked the entire desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screenshot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module calendar does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="785">This module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K3b burning program. you can simply select the albums to be archived. an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation. also, the Autoplay option is available for the Windows platforms.</seg>
<seg id="786">KIPI modules expand the program in which you are invited to add additional functions. you can integrate additional menus, keyboard shortcuts and other capabilities into the program. you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program.</seg>

<seg id="795">If you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place photos of your buddy online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Exporter module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you are using the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this will be used for your authentication. it is therefore your reference to Flickr. a browser is started so you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration the module can send pictures to Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking on Yes, you will get the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. it will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the Exporter module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which shows the current permissions that the module displays. for uploading, you will need spelling permissions. the module currently supports no other permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button the uploading of the photos to Flickr Server will start.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the picture as tags during the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="804">The Public, Friends and Famillily options allow you to set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed in size before uploading. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery-export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery-export has no documentation at present. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate pictures geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width degrees are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsryou can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above dialog appears then. to manage a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file contains, of course, data recorded at the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When loading the file an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the timezone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add it to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. as the dialog takes the coordinates from one call to the next, you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region and zoom. always repeat this until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiaool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab selection allows you to select all the albums that want to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the preview and the text that will appear in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, eg. Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider album defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all its related images. select a folder from where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLSuite, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the standard color depth with other color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Rider preview screensaver allows you to customize some of the settings from the album rider for the preview images, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press abort to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window is not closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to carry out basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information. this can be found in PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please watch IVAv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that want to be packed into the MPEG slide show. then you can start creating the module via extras MPEG slide au.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under picture files in the Portfolio. there you can also change sorting images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV Standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds the picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your preferences, you can start the production of the movie with the button encoded. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go quickly or in all calm a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings right down button.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print job allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve you or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your saved images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: expect ie craw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use them later, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it allows only a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EXif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite the existing file. this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, start number and timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. clicking on the images will allow you to add more images to a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images and add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button Remove Images, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your e-mail client using the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject here.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting a comment in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG among images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original files will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window appears with questions like you want to display your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation enable very elegant image transitions with OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File name option ensures that the file name of the images is shown in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option Images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. thus, the order of the pictures is not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the transition effect. so you should test it before you present your presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly, any transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar on the top left corner of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar, you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">If you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; browse through them, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now entries in each group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you click on the person using the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images on which both persons are to be seen. through this selection method you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can mit & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to store your own preview image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately (if you have no suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to specify which image should be displayed for each individual. to do this, you need to open the image-view window (described in more detail) and displayed in the context menu the entry Categories-Editor. here you can select the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you enter the search in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also specify a date to be searched; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can search all images by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, images showing Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User Manual for & Kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but would rather like to try out features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the fast entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & Kphotoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry Kphotoalbum; -demo. thereupon some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name implies, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The Timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The Timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be shown in the preview pane) and the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select an area, you will only see images of this time frame in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create through the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are grouped into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description, which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you'll see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created which is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without any description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently, all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages are supposed to look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of this page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images which, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. thus, it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if it wants to get a larger image, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder is saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a log supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder a web browser, after the pages have been created, will be launched. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. to enable the import function, see, correctly you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described settings have all three related to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time recording the picture information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to work with & kphotoalbum; this work does not yet again.</seg>
<seg id="932">Mit & Kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kin file. they can import other files into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you are creating a .kin file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file scans the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kin file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images, which you can call via the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the manually copy option to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically copy to the .kim file copy & pastphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, since the .kin file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File import menu... choose, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personell the category Persons of the file to import (if you are a Dane) while this category is the name of your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you'll be asked what categories of the file to import and which categories these categories match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italian holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the different steps of (1) determining information about your images, through (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been expanded and today you will also take care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Kphotoalbum; stores all of its information in the index.xml file in the top of its images. it is a simple XML file that lets you back up with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">If you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can access a window that allows you to change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will learn the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is provided that you can access the F1 key by pressing a button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Look at the dialog that is used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can select an annotation and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up full membership groups, i.e., all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list box above you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& Kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. more information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications together, it can be that the modules with & Kphotoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures using the &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help Menu. don't tell me, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI together are very different, which makes it possible that some modules with & Kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage of sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications arrange their pictures in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums so that you can use the functions with & pastphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & photoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all the pictures that show you the image preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here is a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & Kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, it will work & kphotoalbum; so do so, so whether you would have selected persons to view and pass on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you can see it from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar, you will see the window that you have not added any information about your images. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry pictures that will give you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to annotate any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the image was taken, etc. you can set any image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all images Jesus is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for browsing and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In three lists with a text box, you can set people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again, if you type information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the pictures within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by means that the names used are moved upwards, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and provide these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several pictures, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window displaying the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is a hypertroupe, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Notation dialog's context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it in alphabetical order.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make your own window out of a frame by pulling it out of the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options... button, which offers, among other things, the possibility to store the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to view this window later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. see this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry image in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all images if you don't set any filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you do not have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images from which you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window will appear which you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; namely, you may have saved the pictures somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present so that & kphotoalbum; you can preview these images. however, you can also not view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy and paste files from folders and paste them back into it. so, if you want to avoid annoyance on how to avoid jumbling your images, please purchase a larger hard drive to store all pictures on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that in the end there are those left you may want to make for others and click on the Current View menu to lock the menu entry All except the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry Images, so all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select a password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, everyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to describe all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them sometime. for this reason & pastphotoalbum; via a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in the picture. of course, it shows the picture, but additional information you have to enter via the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the top part of the image you want to see, you can easily drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure what information should be displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all of these options are available on the viewer right-click.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries for this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or Minus. started and stopped the slide show through the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer will use the entire space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you use the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. the plus button zooms in to the center of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the zoom effect.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zoomed. with the equation key sets the zoom, so that every pixel is on the screen of a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus button.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to only mark the image and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images onto a printer to get the pictures designed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while watching one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to display images with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in the picture you will see a picture in which the attributes A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, they are available to you in the browser. so, if you want to see all the images you edit, print or whatever has been selected, simply add all of the images to one with notes. this is described in detail. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you display categories in the particular preview view, you can add features to the images by simply clicking the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; select on the painting from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to do the application of the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. however, not the subobject of an already selected object, as all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following pop-up menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With Delete, either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can view a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a subsorted item. if you only want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross the box locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifting. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a field of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different layout, you can adjust it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom edge of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on top of each other, pull the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the flashcards in the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating view: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamois bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamois bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view allows you to save with View window arrangement... Save. a dialog appears where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovray; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering The Symbol Rendering in the toolbar or select View View menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can add as many Render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render modes... menu View, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense, however, a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the picture, select the check box subsection and enter the picture editing to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality drop down selector you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, images with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighbouring pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive, because each pixel is continuously further divided and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colours.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 x 5 (25) will calculate additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on, Change & Povray; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last adjustment for Renderns quality is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for the display of the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a / Povray; import the scene, select File import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not the complete command range of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovModeler; want to import, write this code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovModeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also include.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your retention and version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window-type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object's range of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for displacements, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects like the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you tick High Detailed Lofidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approximation for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is shown in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is shown in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you activate edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used to render the scenes. the values for depth and threshold value can be set. in the Render-Modi section, you can specify the values for depth and threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window classifications. in the section window orders, it explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window classifications. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list Presence window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created by adding the button and deleting selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new column will create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with Down anchoring the window under the existing window, with card menu you will receive a flashcard view together with the previous view and hovering the view does not anchor in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything without error, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the tools available on the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will now have to use these menus and icons frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovModeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the camera's basic settings, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera's target point. simply click a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the Apply button or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they view the scene from the perspective of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert Finite Body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also indicates the level, though at the moment only as a finite finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look closely at the object tree, you will find that you can fold out the item for the floor when you click on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to practice a unit below the horizon line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first subobject. the pigment is then displayed in the property view. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview only shows a matte black material, because you still need to enter settings for the pigments. always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on the header and the sphere in preview, just click on the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called one-hand. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select each time monochrome and change colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should be able to execute simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be easily created as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: click on 1 (do not forget the input button or the user button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, since you have shifted the floor around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the bottom, the ball will give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subobject and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on sphere Pigment, then select Incolour and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection settings already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even when metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good idea of what options are offered to you & kpovmodeler. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer uses hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and will replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saving will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command to be reversed. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edits undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Store the current window arrangement and open a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can add pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler with this option; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can use this option to add toolboxes for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give color to the surface of an object color on a pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The usage of & cuckshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files you can use when you click the & LMBO; or press Return.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the modus operandi of & kuickshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts for the respective windows can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is checked, loads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you are still viewing the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option you save & cuckshow; when you exit the last opened folder. at the next start & cuckshow, this folder in the browser window opens.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bars to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if the window is larger than the image in the window mode, the background will be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set up & cuckshow; so set up that only some of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slideshow will be repeated until it is interrupted by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the shortcuts for the different modes of & kuickshow here; in the flashcards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the two-part view of the filesystem (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the one-piece view of the filesystem with folders and files in a window.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may possibly set up existing multimedia buttons to work as & Amarok; short commands work. this lets you make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, most of which can also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlist browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function breaks might look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition Amarok has some command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules exist and use kdialog for the user to know why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' kdialog --sorry '# {error}' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be attached to any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. this usually uses the exec () function. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script needs to take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, further information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or piece length) could be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newvolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files in the playlist when a user-defined menu entry can be selected. to add an entry to the menu, you can use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu item titles).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, to do cleaning tasks. this includes, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages which the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archive (.tar) which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as mysq.amarocscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the suffix amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; append. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the Amarok category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful functions and yet is surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can easily drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus. maybe you're just looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to listen to? then the playlists browser is just the right one for you. and if you still find it hard to decide, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. this and many more useful functions make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base directory of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake, you should not have any difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report it to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. see the System Requirements section for details.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up easily via the setup dialog. the setup dialog has multiple cards to set up the various features of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If the option is off, only the playlists window will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1212">Design: this function is only available when & Amarok; compiled with support for moodwin.This will change the color scheme used for the tuning barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Store mood files in music files: this feature is only available when & Amarok; when this setting is enabled, .mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files. otherwise, the .mood files are stored in & Amarok's settings folder (normally ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser of & Amarok; to be started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser, which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save Playlist while editing, automatically save the current playlist in the exit of & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist while moving.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok will use relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keeping the current piece visible during piece changes causes the playlists to roll up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Switching to context browsers automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customise & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting Custom fonts the otherwise gray highlighted section is enabled. you can select Scripts for the following area: playlists windows, Player windows and context browsers. click Select... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Custom color scheme, you have the source of choice and can set up your own color scheme. use the color selection activated for foreground and background color activated.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback at startup causes & Amarok; after program start playback will continue with the piece in place with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is enabled, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box Shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colours for font and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if own colors are not activated, the preset & kde colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users, allowing you to specify the screen of a multi-monitor environment to display the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio Output flashcard allows you to select an audio driver from the dropdown box. some drivers still activate more settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection collection is used to set all the settings for your collection. this includes the folders and the type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolders recursively: this causes that & Amarok; Browse both the selected as well as their sub-folders for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok; add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists then appear in the playlist browser later.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql configuration section is used to insert the database for & Amarok; on calculator: will enter the host on which the MySql database is located. afterwards, the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data needed to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card menu addresses the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transfer the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send the played pieces and update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok; to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Call similar interpreters: after enabling this setting, & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters will be called to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no other KDE packets. so you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedesket.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by using ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. after that you can delete the file and recreate the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1246">This is mostly due to the fact that Taglib file crashes when reading the meta information. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. turn off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the E-Mail will open automatically in case of a crash). if it is a common crash and send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstated with this command: Perl-MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in status bar (shuffle mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are ignored. note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: icon lookup error: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7Qpixmap, then please check whether Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarocapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf to adjust that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">You can also help other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freeno.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please only make a mistake there if you find something about fixing a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do pieces of music come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the Start subwindow was converted to the Statistics window. you can find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for rating by the user while points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the evaluation columns must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show review. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, then press Del on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select from the drop-down menu Remove From Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file into the playlist and drop it down, just as you would do with other files. it's as simple as that: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the toolbar toolbar, next to the addition button, the Playlist button is stored. click on it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Probably you don't have the program xmms-config. install the xmms-devel package and install & Amarok; new. also look for libvisual, this package contains many very nice visualizations.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the real question must be Which media types support GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support pretty much every imaginable audio format.</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! maybe you are using Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which in default no MP3 decoder are included (for patentlegal reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat, mp3 kde, input button</seg>
<seg id="1271">Start the YaST Online update and install the 'Multimedia Option Pack 1'. so... & Amarok; plays MP3's from: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously deliver audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to provide a different sink (for example, sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would just want to hear a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decoded it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Also XMMS decoded the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound server with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!).</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x, there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. the magnifying sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use a different driver (the xine driver was heavily optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less bearers respond to the visualizations. yes, this is an error, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; off. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you must register all the components. follow the follow-up register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok before!): - Download the ffmpeg, compile and install it. then execute the logs, once as system administrators and once as your normal user. then delete all the mpeg files in the GStreamer module (you will find the module folder with follow-config / GStreamer-config) and restart the log-register. start & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use, yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows are later explained in detail. they provide information about the current piece on each different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you might notice that the subwindow is gone. the information shown here is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; the information can also be collected in the Statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to recreate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find further information about the current piece using the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see how often and when the play was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in context browsers, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the images may have arbitrary names but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context-browser will also display cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play instantaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer. this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current performer.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information to display in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to immediately start playing. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using scripts themselves. once you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. this does not require any running text script.</seg>

<seg id="1358">Grouping performers - only groups the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - At first, the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further division is made according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, default 0 - albumname is used.</seg>

<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings for the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection once you change something to the selected folder. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located right under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The search filter is a selection field with which you can filter out the recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from the last 24 hours to a year. of course, you can also select your total collection, so that the filter is switched off practically.</seg>

<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to use playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser includes the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>

<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar that lets you pick music from a entered URL. for example, enter the tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter key, you can access music from there to the playlist and drop.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist becomes longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping files. in the event the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>

<seg id="1389">If you enter words separated by whitespace, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then enclose the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign before the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bath. this looks for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then click on the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order. then, the entries will be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>

<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP features, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; -program common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void CopPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () void bitCd () void bitCd () void bitCd () void bitCd () void bitCd () void bitCd () void copyright () void BurnDvd () void copyright</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above mentioned K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void of void reference (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (QString path, QString Quartet) void reference void reference (Qstring path, QString Quartet) void reference void reference (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files to the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDatCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudioCreator; is an audio CD; a read-out for & kde; with it you can easily read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudioCreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; files in WAV files on the hard disk) and by many encoders encoding these wav files (these encoders need to be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into MP3 or OGG format or in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to install anything themselves. however, only the encoders need to be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">What encoding / file format should be used? chapter Which encoder gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudioCreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device protects the protection, it is not possible to bypass a protected audio CD; in any case, you can avoid buying pirated audio CDs; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily use to read a & CD is explained. this will guide (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">It can collect information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, all manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. on the page step by step, you will find further information about how this program is used, as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB file request of the CD data according to the arrangement of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - when an encoder is configured in the encoder settings tab in the setup dialog - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Open a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder than the default. it must be noted that the encoder in the encoding settings tab was configured in the setup dialog before.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, pieples) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main setup dialog of & kaudioCreator, with different cards (such as encoders, for setting the encoder). here you must go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsets is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This attitude should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approx. 5.5. requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good for music of teenagers, portable devices and autostereos. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or fetched automatically from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / needed with & kaudioCreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD title to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudio creator must be added; the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudioguides; parameters that can be needed (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what is freedb: a free database in which people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information rather than themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (remark of the translator: it is meant by the author) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being added to the & CD; neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained from a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioCreator; is actively selecting a check box (sending one address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (fake) address than the ones in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when invoking the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. when & kaudiocreator, when using freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from CD and CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see also that the cdparanoia package from the right distribution must first be installed, if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening there are predefined lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set the encoder. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for pre-defined encoders.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read messages on it, and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check the cover of the CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything but are somehow still uncertain what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You have to install cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the / usr / share / cd directory is made and that you have write rights on it (eg by trying to copy something inside with the Conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & kaudio creator; something that is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them at any reading of a CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the read-out program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive exists, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing records of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">There is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in the case of incomplete information, select so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are comfy and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD; it must be connected to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later unsatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; renamed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually insert everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but since many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to send any data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of matching pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: check this to discard the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then the path / folder can be specified in which the wav files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">The command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' Tags can also be deleted if necessary.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to encode more than a wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you chose the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described how the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been set up and set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up as we are comfy and want to collect the data from the freedb. the process described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from those for a & CD; with successfully fetched data fetched. therefore, you will learn the & CD; enter data manually instead of extracting them from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, the & CD now has to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, please refer to the section questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD is successfully fetched by the freedb, all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that best fits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Enter the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'current title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album can be used for individual comments, the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful recall of the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 Tags, you have unlimited field length, at least what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see Help for the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously coincides with the style of the end-to-end CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. simply enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next row in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the tracks that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or off. make sure all pieces are selected or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Once you have started reading the selection process by clicking on the button selection, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see you when trying to work with a encoder you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered in this example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is encoding piece 1 in MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in the case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">With CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions, however, already contain a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; -package. if you read this, you have probably already done it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help such as the program can be customized to your needs, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that invokes many different programs has many different settings. it is best to read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still best reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>

<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the & kmid; (for several pieces it will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid, a piece plays, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the template and thus change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the template LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space key acts like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu piece, thus interrupts the play. press the space bar while no play is played, start & kmid; play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others use both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the text events or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also includes buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played by the series. in this section stands how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the collection under the item Organize. click New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired names in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not saved. keep in mind when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it has to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by adding the button. it appears again the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic added to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the row from the menu Collections submenu, the songs will be played in the order in which they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back to a song, select the previous piece, select the previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow key on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General-MIDI events translate into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which transforms all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in the events of type Change patch to Trumpet, making it possible to sound a trumpet when originally playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe and Gus cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different textual ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the key map"... END Define keymap "Another Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can provide support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how General MIDI Patches can be mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the sequence and leave no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">If your keyboard does not support a rifle shot (e.g. with clay 60), you can use the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the drum patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussionist instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound represents the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are imaged on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as are their presence. you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The maps are mainly used to map the sounds of the percussion channel. for example, take a look at the provided maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, simply do this in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map with the name Name is needed for this channel. of course, if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio of pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, it is converted using the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards attempt to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try it around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole host of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played right now.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button will not be green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the View channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The Tempo-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed, etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Be sure to enable automatic add to the collection before. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have open a & konqueror; -windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (when I play a karaoke file). in this way, I need to change to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn on the automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you only want to play the first file. so adjust the settings Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to further write to & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga. I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I don't have much spare time for my hobbies, but I try to write MIDI files, make music and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid, or even if you simply want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a lot of joy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. I'll list all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file (if you want to). but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid, completely written in my spare time and didn't get any money from anyone for it. I want to emphasize that I am programming only because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thank you also Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westhoke, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also apply to all these excellent musicians on the web, giving us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, it can be found on its homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files of supported formats, supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as for playback DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, check the page The KDE Website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the menu bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchical level. if you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can also be changed by an editor, and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select playlists from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without having to match the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / exit.xml. the format needs to be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of Start-Animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; img dur = "indism src =" file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ lt; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smilgt; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the buffer size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here you can see the mplayer output.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for that playback device in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting the backend by mimetype. here's an example like a 'flash' using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & KMPlayer; 'flash' can play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is ready to start in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. the started process is called crapplayer. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a given back end for a specific mime type (of course only if this was determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play cards from TV, either by using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used must be configured and the TV channels. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, use the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer only can use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video equipment under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">At the time the origin of this documentation is used, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, versource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any clue how to make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is supposed to be user root after the device is plugged in. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, so why do I have to check my CPU for their performance every time?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is overhau. kxineplayer automatically needs the last stored value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex files; retrieval can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI file (constrained D e V ice I ndependent file)] was created, jump & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the common output type of & tex; or & latex. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are used to use the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI; file has been clicked, the corresponding section in & latex; the preset search is the exact opposite.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this feature is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: der & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is called "disappointments" and there is no call from & Okular; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">The selection fields have been developed for quick insertion of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... Available & latex, orders for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box for further items is to enter articles such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, an image or another element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a designated description (selection of a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ ee is used for the definition of the font. it is possible to specify the font sizes for the main text, the fusion nodes, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When invoking & kile, two options are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the\\ documentrange contain the settings for the command. setting [12 pt] specifies the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also happen later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s Bauen or the quick construction of a button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, the logging should be checked for errors. if it is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font palette is created, and only a few columns should have another font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only checked within the environment (from\\ begin to environment} up to\\\\\\\ environment}. there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold printing, italics, substutations, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {$emph}: this command is for the italics print and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be displayed in italics with\\ rh {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {ratio} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background is presented to write the source code with the & latex; a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text is entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. at least one quotation, a few places in bold and italic form and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). an external viewer must close its window.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (eg. D e V ice I ndepends). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file, the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed (if the printer is set correctly) by means of file printing (in the viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI file is made from the & latex; source text is created, the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; binary files. for this purpose only Modern can be set up under Settings box... Building Tools can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the pre-selection, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on the pre-selection process. the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer is then taken.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; opened and jump to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using a quick construction of the & DVI; a error can be present. if there is an error, this will be summarised in the log file or message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The Logging File will explain the source code error source. in the editor, the heads of the LaTeX errors and other LaTeX errors can be used for the cracks between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the flawed line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & kile; jumps to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicking on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When choosing empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hifige users of & latex; most often use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be stored in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selection of file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by means of a new file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string will be replaced by entering document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document is created in this way, the following steps must be performed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the template can be selected instead of the standard template.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any kind of latex; a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility to read and extract from many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for programmers; can be done in the menu directly from & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To know more about & placards, and its possibilities, the manual should be consulted to Kate. users of & kile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter's work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical and latex; -command reference, which can be called via the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of virtually any of the commands that can be found in & latex, as well as its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-clicking with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that this means that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with a defined Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to search the different kinds of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional bounces. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entries Edit bounces or the corresponding key rings enable the jump to the next or last jump stamp. this jump stamp is also highlighted so that it is automatically triggered at the first input of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; although & brands; already offers excellent opportunities, were added into & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports & kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit Styles, the following commands are included for the selection of text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">This expanded meaning only includes tables, and latex, and all other lines of the source code. the only beuatiful thing in & kile; is that the Absinews are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection also has an extended meaning, as this command is also called & latex; -commands with a ¼ cklayer (\\) and an additional star (*) expires at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & kile; offers with its own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit removal, the following commands are included to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to edit droplet heel.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex. therefore, & kile; for further orders under Edit environment for a more effective simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">When the cursor is before or inside the\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the above-mentioned environment can be lost quickly. this command completes the last opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups specified by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closed bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">When the cursor is in front of or behind the curvature of a & tex; -group # is jumped to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering a number of nested welded group clips, the above-mentioned group can quickly be lost. this command completes the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple suits are used as a yarn. for the appropriate implementation is used in & kile; the sign "for two simple application marks. also for the completion of the application, the sign" is used.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double connection sign can be set up under Settings box... LaTeX to be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It is also possible to use foreign language settings (e.g. augerman or French) and thus German or French symbols. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shift shift; enter & kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a Listen environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not only a line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Complete the current line with\\\\ with an end-to-end line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set and latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set under Settings... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -surroundings and thereby all Et characters (amp;) to one another. when using Shift, Alt; amp; seeks & kile; after the next tab in the above line. although this tab is unfortunately not the corresponding tab, add & kile; some space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code completion, it has been added to & kile; for specific commands (mostly for & latex). there are three different modes available for automatic completion. all of these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings... Completely adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning of a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment}, & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When using the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and, as a result, the list of references is possible. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by typing another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. of course, the descriptions are removed when choosing a command. alternatively, can be inserted from & kile, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing snap-mark NÃ ¤chest jump mark and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">You can adjust settings to these lists. you can select different parts lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as extensions of the general language use can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for setting environments. it always needs to begin a few letters with\\ begin and the call of the depletion mode will result in a large-scale list of environment commands. on the other hand, the vicinities are used so often that & kile; a special mode for the complete destruction of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invading the space on the menu of the Entry environment or the key root Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears to\\ begin. then the ambient temperature compensation can be continued in the simplest way and by using the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will be closed automatically. as soon as & kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; set up... box; All settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of the Complete Package Mode for & tex; - and latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supports user-defined lists of cutouts, which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... Kile Complete. as an example of a collection list, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word is in complete mode of Remembrance, or the key Ctrl + Alt space bar is initiated, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Great WÃ ¶ rterbÃ ¼ chers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many authors are written in a document more than once. thus, & kile; the completeness for all already written wishes.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the settings box... Kile Complete can be switched off. here, the threshold for the display of the compensation can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The missing files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nliche home folder. mode is available for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (dictionary) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphic design of the graphics makes it easy to insert graphics as simple as possible. in view of the basic principles of graphic formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for descriptions and re-orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To examine the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all the tools are grouped in groups in the creation compiling, creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for the viewer as well as the eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used for the key viewer Alt; 2. afterwards the DVI-file can be converted to a PS file via Alt; 4.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the quick construction command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will be opened each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be about the project New Project.... Here you will find the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When filling the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows to execute ECMAScript code. scripts can be administrated above scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet finished yet and can still be used in other versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods has:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & kile; offers a lot of different aids to support the users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; supplied with lots of documents. this includes a documentation for the included packages and another and latex; -Reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described), but rather is a complete manual for the & latex. since it is a very large document, it is divided into & kile; it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; the finding of the correct document is not always easy. as possible assistance offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application contains texdoctk, which contains a database with all to & kile; delivered documents and this for a graphic surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the greatest asset is the search for package names or banners. from & kile, only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or using the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly and latex; - / tex; source code editor, which can be executed on all systems with installed & kde; & kde; is also a part of the Fink project, which makes & kile; also on & Mac; with installed OS-X can be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1869">Many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the & kile; -project and to sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use under consideration of the & GNU; information on the contributors there is in the MenÃ ¼ hober & kile;.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a part, we start with the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all of the included plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a storage location, you use & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often, several people work in a sort of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift; F7 project project properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking for the team member from the list and clicking the Setze site. the currently selected member (their identity) appears in bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and setting up your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments. see further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see in for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something special happens in the project. one example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file to CVS, as soon as it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page Event Configuration of the Shift, F7 Project Properties Dialoges can create, edit and delete events.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Input comment is simple. either the comment entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment section followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a designated member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the registered nickname of the team member, role in the project from the following options: team Leader Subproject Leader Could be given the appropriate area or subproject names, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles-names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the brackets and tags: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the Settings menu. here, only via & quantaplus; -specific settings are handled, a short description for the others can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up via settings Quanta... called. this dialog covers some pages that are dealt with one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; with regard to tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / Sumpy of Tags: large / Sumpy of automatically inserted tags. normal wholesale / lowercase means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagua files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lower case means the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tagua files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags: when checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this is inserted immediately after & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not automatically include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and end-tag: when turned on, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic set-up of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetyps for detecting various types of files. by means of the Standard Reset button, the defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise file-opened files (where the file's encoding can be skipped). however, this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. however, this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documenting can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or documentation in a folder), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI modes and docking / dependent views. it complies with the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of the parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse-click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree during editing and how deep can be automatically opened during a change in the structure tree. empty knots are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those with no element found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are grouped into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP's. this means there can be a valid group for PHP where the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins can be managed here. plug-ins are part-applications of third parties, which can be reused by any part-capable application, the best-known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be given:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard directory like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "read-only" mode: check if the plugin refuses to load the load. only-Lese-Kparts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select allows to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, from version 3.3, the debugger was completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the button options next to the debugger plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view, in which all stops, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to the debugger if necessary, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counter to debugging session Start the session. closes the connection to the debugger or stops listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to request a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger Output function.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debug is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without informing the variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a debug is given, the execution begins as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, and if possible in functions and include it will be corrected incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next one as if it were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can be used to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale and this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a kde; front end and a part of xsldbg, which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can and quantaplus; help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packets (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for Markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / or css files. tag folders include two file types, the tags file and descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic toolbars of image buttons (above the editing pane) to insert text and instructions in a document faster than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the file descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow quick inserting of tags into a document without danger of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing as a single element of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for Class type Class. the class name for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Valid for Type-method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">When yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a just element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags describing how to display this attribute, etc; This is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groups the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur for any attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files need to start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but look at & & lt; character. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause any fracture, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog box is above in & quantaplus; -windows to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the check takes place only when loading the TagXML files into & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following one example for a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "option" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a simple & descriptionrc; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = default 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set actions with Settings... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key abbreviation assigned to this action. by clicking on the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; the current shortcut can be removed with K1.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when performing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way tries and quantaplus; the script at the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can receive input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard error output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written to the standard output, by setting the input field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the Markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day has attributes and you are planning its use, enable dialog "Edit Tag" when available, so that entering the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igor! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol, that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in its distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose editing size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you remember what the action is doing, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view of the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually displayed as los, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this icon will insert & lt; startfiles; -tag will be inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions set... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, if there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; -functions to the toolbar or it should be shared this to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar to set the toolbar preferences. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by half of all symbols to make sure everything is working.</seg>
<seg id="2056">If New XML does not exist, it will create the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the proper folder. please adjust its file descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most important extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html Sec2.3</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation so something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a sub-folder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of tree view & mdash; Folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified this in your docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for usage by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">Mit & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the separable resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at various points, there is an email-sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team needs them as correct and useful for publishing. to make a different contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New Resource dialog, you will need to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD (DTEP) menus, Upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the statement of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus. however, creation may be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagxXML format. there is the easier way to automatically convert DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and conversion of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string containing in! Doctype Day, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, bring & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand these and to take full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts, without their understanding and quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus. from toolbars to actions everything that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be everything from & CSS to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emlows the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the flashcards with information and the toolbars. please consult, and for more information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a contextual menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all folder, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or carry out CVS orders to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-clicking in the editor section leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents, such as basic editing steps (cutting / copy / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, or opening the file when the string is called a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the Editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. as part of the further extension of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage medium can be executed using the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all options are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project. more about templates is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set to the position of the element in the document. by clicking on an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application system geared to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can download prepackaged documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the beneficial information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed provide all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed tar archive via & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; -files on your system. for this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in front of your bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the most magnificent web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be recorded that & quantaplus; as a product based on outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community based. & kde; scaffolding is not only possible this is possible, but allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly converted into a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently developed and supported by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest record being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML to insert from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard to & URL; -Description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / off. this allows you to select blocks with the help of the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Screen and turn on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries predictably or next, depending on the position of cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Load the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project toolbar. these are kept in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be stored by means of settings actions... added. toolbars are saved by toolbar toolbars, or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; -Team for the toolbar available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to upload tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access them. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; who has made you or anyone else and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without renewing the whole & DTEP. if this is global and there is not a write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu Standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent integration means that & quantaplus; inserting by toolbar is denied when this day contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on it. clicking on an activated plugins will disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the kate or version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for development. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, changeover sometimes may need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the index card mode, which is also the default setting or the subwindow mode that corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the status bar to be displayed at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influences any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of documents, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or add which ones and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the mouse pointer environment but has not yet been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in best from top to bottom, as for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you have the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and templates by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or whole folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great when you have static web content that you want to download and change. for server-like scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, don't hook it up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the files you want by hooks, or by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new Project Wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub-window profiles or using the Shift + Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcards are possible) which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, even files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the profiles upload profiles, high loading profiles (see in) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by using a custom tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, modify, or delete events. event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. currently, this behavior cannot be affected.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; is closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files will find. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opened with... in the context menu on the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">The profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button is blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when generating programs. this option is useful when frequent upload of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-load profiles can be created and therefore the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in one project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted on the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings tool toolbar Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above are toolbars in & quantaplus; the best way to create toolbars using the toolbar menu. the addition of toolbars is treated at the bottom of the section adding toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either by means of a context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which a new tool bar can be created, and other actions such as toolbars can be executed, toolbars rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action will be displayed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with Settings... and set settings actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets, and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be edited by any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually more specialized documents are created in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in an appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area over and over again in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note down to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. see for more information about the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select File As template Save As a local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it is saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select Text in your document and click File As template Save selections as local / Project templates. alternatively, the selection can be dragged along with dragging and dropping onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as pulling and dropping or pasting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project files to create a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very target-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or link dynamically with & PHP; create, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / templates / templates. each folder is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described models; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes have been inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder would be set so, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they are explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you're likely to be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or filed text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with custom headers / footers a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing out right mouse button) using a complete command file for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source text editor accessible via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -editor in a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol shows the vohemial of & PHP; -source text. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the VPL; editor, and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor. pressing F9 activates the active cursor from one window to another, keeping the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. by choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small spout for fast computers and a large span for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the web page, it is possible to choose the document properties. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created using the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual coding. this allows you to modify the following:</seg>

<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>

<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbars, as in the source code editor. it should be noted that inserting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed each other anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the table assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many points. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed exactly within these lines. and there were no references to places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost into a full-value file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful if two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result to be expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and contrasts with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you have to check code frequently, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more anger if someone alters the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 2 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialogue allows manual typing of filenames, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. open dialogue notes your selection and indicates it next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare an entire file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you'd have to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only the dropping of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping of text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that windows C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, the color you see differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in character strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summing column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have rows. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription edition:, the filename and [changes] if you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to spend the next dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, every difference at the same time has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and maybe choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a mark you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignoring the numbers or Ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, down, side down, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insertion button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Strg-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upward / Strg-picture Abroad) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl paste). if it is checked, whatever you select will be automatically copied to the clipboard and no manual copying is required. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use return line + newline\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line end of the source files, so you should not use kdiff3; also do not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when they are finished and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides typefaces with variable width, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, you will see differences in italic script. if the selected font does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered inastert. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically adjusts an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press enter or return, the indentation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, any selections will be automatically copied to the clipboard, then copying the manual into the clipboard is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system you use.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The second step compares each line. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a '\\ r' cart and a newline feed '\' at the end of a line, while others will only save a newsprint '\'. if this option is enabled, carriage returns will be made visible, but will be treated like a white character. during the merge, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated in default. comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jumping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge. see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if already one such backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to & kdiff3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">A short note about the local code is displayed above the selection fields for encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessor command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to set the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn on this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in the text or reviews columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignoring C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded Excel column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd rather like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just leave out the less important windows. (this option is in the Window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this feature is used to restart the merge again, the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal preprocessor command was specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command processor. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this prefabrication command for line sequences to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergular expression that fits all characters in one line. the\\ 1 in the creation string refers to the found text in the first clammerncouple. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some key words to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, a preprocessing command for line sequences is needed which removes the automatically generated text:\\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\ $\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you might even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessor command for line spacing. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each mark between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so almost deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different like perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / replacement / SCHALTER' However perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you are using a normal preprocessor, the newline pre-processor looks at the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and, in the worst case, destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a suggestion to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate coefficients and show the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... selects selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, then folder 3 is used as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start the merge, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will inform a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3 shows; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually displayed folded. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or double-click on the object, or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All sub-directories and all subdirectories with which you can open or fold up all directories.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the interaction queue can not be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In the case of identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. with folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirtiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such bad objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such bad objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified and if the option synchronize dirs. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file B; copied directly after merging, B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the new file is selected instead of merging (unsafe), then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the same date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is executed after the other. you status column shows the skill if the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is completed, you should check out a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts only appears when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at one time. if you have selected all interaction actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-folder merge mode, C is used as the destination, while B is selected as the destination and when syncing A and / or B is used as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check afterwards whether all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select folder merge / continue in the list menu, or press F7 (the key shortcut). to bring only the current entry, select Run action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid merging actions exist due to conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Execute, Simulate, and Abort.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations once you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merge-window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, you can re-launch / resume directory merge, or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you encounter a mistake, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to solve the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually merged, you will notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) will not work together again. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3 (Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon; separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid wildcards: '*' and '?' (e.g. * .cpp; * .h).</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be typed more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be typed more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-formatted files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a previous points. marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: if the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; do not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to only compare the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">There is no real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are equal. this can be useful e.g. when copying the modified date. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the rules for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. the results of merging files will also be saved in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, copying the newer file is proposed as an action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe, as it is provided that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of single files, not just the merging of entire folders. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view stays visible while merging single files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can turn off the main window in the pop-up menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start folder merging. you can also use the current file merge from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be terminated and the file will not be merged again if you start folder merging.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory: directory Menu: new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDB3 uses this to read files and folders. this way you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative und. or.. .This is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Trust of the Size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference beholder in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; suppose the file has a unified file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program will start to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this doesn't work if none of the original files exist. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part execution, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path, or they will go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only one non-white character is different, the line is not treated as identical. if similar lines are 'next to each other, this is is this subscribe is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text, all of a sudden, No src is left, and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use a different editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and lots of people from the Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or the ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should have no problems in compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cutting (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position resp. replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program, you need to re-read the current folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This will also cause identical files to be copied when merging into the destination folder. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the A, B and C labeling under the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini-preview of all virtual worktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, quit them or shift them. this works both within a desktop and in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspace as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible within a desktop as well as on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; click on an application within & Kpager; however, if an application within & Kpager is clicked, the icon and name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and End. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to full size of desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is enabled, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual workspaces are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager display; display the numbers of virtual workspaces. if it is enabled together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is selected, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & Kpager; shown.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is enabled, the current programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty working areas are displayed to allow them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; in a 2xN grid it appears, as is made from pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontally, all virtual workspaces are horizontal and vertical in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selections of switches... allow the dialog settings to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the dialog settings. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must login as user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you will need a functioning installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a select window in the following.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a moveable magnifier. alternatively, you can set a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer setting. please note that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the Shift key, or press the & MMB; use the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the drop-down window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save to a file, copy to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulated a mouse click once the mouse cursor remains on the same spot for a while. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and that each mouse click treats pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by mouse clicks and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain. unfortunately, the mere moving of the mouse may cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The intelligent shift activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulated. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. this smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be done by the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool, executes a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent shift is enabled, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after holding down the mouse button waits before it lets the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click by mouse-shift. if this feature is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these moves are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, when & kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; available. for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the status after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent shift should be switched off at first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later pull the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce & kde response times; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of at which point a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear soon if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. you can easily scrape the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool, when a move is just started. if you use the intelligent shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try and kmousetool; continue to execute clicks and set the cursor somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but park the mouse on a neutral zone of your desktop if you want to make a keyboard input.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shift, but I don't make it to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible to copy and paste text into the clipboard or perform any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent shift only when you just start using & kmousetool. instead, select a mouse click at the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this time, when & kmousetool, the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when moving the move time. later you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; click the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is frozen. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and which causes pain to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a pulling activity to start before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can also drag and drop with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2530">& kmouth; is a program that allows dumb users to let their computer speak for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2531">With the program & kmouth; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves. the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screenshot), enter the command, which will later be used for the voice output of text. for more details, please refer to the description of the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the standard text passage book. from the text passages you can choose often used text passages without having to type in. text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screenshot) you determine the dictionary for the word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can compare the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary so that only correctly spelled words can be included in the word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screen shot) and a run memory of the already spoken phrases (the upper white field in the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have correctly set up kmouth, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken sentence is attached to the drive memory. you can select phrases that are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the menu entry settings kmouth; set up... open the settings dialog of & kmouth; this dialog contains two cards, voice output and settings, the page Wortergänger as well as the page KTTSD language service.</seg>
<seg id="2538">In the input field of the language edition, enter the command to invoke the language generator. in the selection field below the input field, specify the character encoding, with the text transmitted to the language generator.</seg>

<seg id="2547">The Wortergänger page contains a list of dictionaries for the word completion. in the main window next to the input field shows & kmouth; a drop down box if this list contains more than one dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of books or export them to a file. below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection field.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the desired language for this source; & kmouth; then read the & kde; documentation. the frequency of the single words is determined simply by counting the assignment. in addition, you can compare the wordlist with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert just written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option you can combine the available dictionaries. & kmouth; then ask what dictionaries are merged, and how they should be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option you create a new, empty dictionary with no entries. da & kmouth; add new words automatically to the dictionary, create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window for editing text passages is split. in the upper part, the text passages are displayed as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated shortcut. if you have selected a text passage book, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Add actions like new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either through the selection in the menu bar, in the toolbar or via a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">The order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dragging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the & Alt; key.</seg>

<seg id="2619">Filter for string replacement offers a good option in & ktales; wrong emphasized or flawed messages to correct. the file kmail.xml, which is included in the scope of delivery of & ktts; is a good example. you remove the tags br and b from the messages sent by KMail, and also the expression / local / inbox as this can be assumed in most cases as presupposed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktons; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech speech speech. it is useful for improving pronunciation to replace spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to avoid specific flaws of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the work of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-Dispatcher" works with a text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. if the output of the Screen Reader is read, the retained jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has precedence and stops the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News is the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you're reading & eg; a long text read on a web page, you can talk to & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The remainder are simple text orders. each order that you send from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, except the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; exactly one such one reads, this output will pause and end.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reactors. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character Translator replaces parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is delivered with pre-defined string substitution filters that allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Converter uses a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; included in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speech selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card holder, you can read text from KDE messages above.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for a voice output. if the filter states that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notifications to & ktts, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters established. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample for setting string assertion filters. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it just has to distinguish itself from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the creation column. the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries are appended from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; button at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs can be obtained by qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if, for example, qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 displays, you may only enter copete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string release filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box dialog. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices, speech speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the output of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation filters (SDB filters). SBDs begin to subdivide words into individual sentences. thus, you can start to start reading faster with reading, since only the first set must be synthesized, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set limit identifier filters. at the first start of & ktts; a set limit recognition filter is set automatically as the default. you can modify its settings or add additional set limit recognition filters, but beginners will get discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the language of speakers by trying out. switch off the speaker selection and select text to read. switch on the list of speakers, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then start faster with the reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit identifier filter will be set up automatically when you start ktorimgr for the first time. it cannot be turned off, only be removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit identifier filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set limit recognition filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (chats), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal sentence identifier filter from accidentally, you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc included.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the folder selection box, you can overwrite the speech settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the uppermost on the card holder). in other words: no speakers properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the features of a speaker set up. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, choose & Desktop; otherwise choose & Desktop; the Speaker, who best meets the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the speaker you want. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is available when you know that a particular application is sent in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the Speaker range, which is most likely to delete the following, click the Standard Speaker button and then use the Speaker closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Tmgr crashes when it's started. I compiled debug support, but I don't get back tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & Desktop. you will probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not resolved by this, you may need a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>

<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but ktorimgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice to the file $KDEHOME / share / captsd / festivalve / capsd / capsd / capsfesint / Voices. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the audio map audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesize moduls such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card reader device. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -by-SSml reforming filter, and set up the microphone speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not create that websites are read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktales; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. thus festival does not produce errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags to convert SSml to Saber. same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate string release filter and now I can go back and forth; no more set-up or go back. on the tab ordering is indicated, the order only consists of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>

<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; -package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolcenter; shown. the Network Setting module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu; start.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the Network Setting module, it attempts to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual option is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and the release date. by checking the setting non-again questions, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Change the network settings is only possible in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means that the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. in system management mode, click the button system management mode at the bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Network Interface Panel is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Network Interface Panel:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... to set up the device in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced settings will display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out by a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be set without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off as needed. switch on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off as needed. activating an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Defines the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution part of the list name resolution makes it easy to manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted in priority by selecting an entry or descending or descending in the list with buttons down or down.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group Calculator to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will add the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group Calculator to the name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known to name refers to hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when there is no DNS server available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains some well-known hosts some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still under review will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has multiple alias names, press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Default calculator will display.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Setting module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes, you have to set the following command in one & console.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf, is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient to install & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used as a kpackage or the installation tool for its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde suffices; not, but in addition, the development packages are required with libraries and other applications.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetwork.conf. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, and in the second section all of & knetworkconf are discussed; changing configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be deployed in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assigned to a network interface. in other networks, on & off, the network administrator is the contact point providing a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot simply be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, usually addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for IP redirection.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, where they are located in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is any other content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is dumped by the script in the SuSE config file. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it provides the ability to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be included in & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; wears the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognizes & kdat; don't know the pre-tensioning force on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detect & dat; the pretension, search for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the index of the tape is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">When everything goes smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by fold the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a message by changing the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive assumes that a tape has to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the tape from & kdat. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and capacity, & kdat, continues with the format of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you hit the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog opens for backup. in this dialog, you can still check the selected files and change settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the backup dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears to check. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the tape index file by means of the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders specified in backup files, only the files in it are backed up that are on the same file system as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be registered separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file from the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the button files & quot; & gt; & lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding option of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, it transmits & kdat; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try to lock the discards from the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the integration of & kdat; automatically ejecting the tape. do not use this option for Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option enabled, tries to change the hardware block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you have to tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only contain one storage block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this icon is only active when a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlogs; is a & kde; -viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlogs; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information about problems appearing on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlogs; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlogs; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sets the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlogs; experienced users can provide quick access, for example, to information about problems appearing on their server. & ksystemlogs; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlogs; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in this manual and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlogs; features that allow the individual protocol lines of a protocol file to be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlogs; first, try to open the most important log file of the system - the system protocol. if you don't see it, you have & ksystemlogs; most probably do not run with system administrators.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion, or after entered strings. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only the log lines are displayed that match to the selected filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if there is a string of the filter search term in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be matched to the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system protocol, select the column process, and in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so you will see & ksystemlogs; all log lines that were sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of the stage error are displayed with a more eye-catching color than log lines of the level indication. the color representation of protocol lines can be shut down in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new protocol lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlogs; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlogs; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlogs .forum-software.org. Dort you will find further up-to-date information about the sources of Supply of & ksystemlogs;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlogs; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlogs; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named below) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is quickly becoming standard for system start-up when starting up the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might attempt to convert a machine to system V init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first in / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly into / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you will need a script for any system service you want to start when starting the system or switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, but system services do not include such things as setserial that is only launched once. such calls are according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located at / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if it doesn't have much use for it. you can also configure a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / rc.d, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the program init at different places and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the initial area, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up, then proceed to repair it by reboot the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; furthermore, I could also have a user-run level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts between levels or change the position inside a level by pulling it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or position). this only happens if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them into a new zone. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste in the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sort number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the sorter numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present, there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or bottom of the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, drag it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it in the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort number or the name of an entry manually, press the key to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine is constantly reeling. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE, or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not meet any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or wrongly configured.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This program refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the entry in the File menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, user and user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user and group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created where you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card menu appears if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if there is space limitation (quota) enabled and initialized for at least a built-in file system (see quotas user / quotas group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The cardholder group informs about the group belonging to the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add the default operating system, remove, change operating system add, remove, change and more.</seg>
