although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors , and practi@@ sed his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensified .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived in whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stays behind the mountain with his opinion , as one says so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and cons@@ ented to him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in repub@@ li@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that welcomes people from all over the world , a deeply believing human with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung also agreed not with the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix S@@ uns in the game .
Tr@@ ump In@@ tolerance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for the environment for her lifetime , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied in them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump suspected his way to the nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , it offered me a footh@@ old and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out however that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
arran@@ ging people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account by the hec@@ tic changes in their churches .
could it be that those elec@@ tors , most of whom know , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( reminiscent of the White against all the other ethnic groups , &quot; white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means so much like s@@ ling@@ shot trauma ) , as the Great Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has done so spectac@@ ul@@ arly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ ans , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere else be possible anywhere in the world .
however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , a huge portion of the White American promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded by saying : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son was pleased sent him a message .
that &apos;s Tr@@ ump Land now , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through garbage .
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ah ?
the fact that the music that is played at both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a number of years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with gle@@ aming eyes and playing in the hu@@ stle you learn day after day trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the leadership of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums all of which were made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local econom@@ ist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , re@@ members the beginning time :
at first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had been shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .

these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before the other coast of Africa was looking for .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this kind at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were rapidly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to fire one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to stay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pil@@ la@@ ging the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fishing ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters back then .
&quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and support each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
the deliberate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once obstruc@@ ted by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the slu@@ g tempo , with information between individual countries , the actions are happening nowadays in real time , with trace@@ ability on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this makes it possible for authorities to flag ships fishing in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship puts its caught fish on its way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information . this means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions like sailing under false flag , fake licence documents , speci@@ fying fantasy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you systematically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is now trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 suspected ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found fle@@ eting ships .
as a result of his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that hide .
&quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
for example , some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , which cannot be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information with each other . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i aims to help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the oce@@ an@@ front organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally via the position of each trac@@ table vessel .
&quot; get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also sc@@ are them off .
ships that used to be f@@ ished without license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile posted a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats purchase more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 six countries joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , following exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With security , the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia reported its first big triumph : in October , it launched Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship traveling without licence and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now prohibited .
the ship was still penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the ocean .

their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are prot@@ esting against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s res@@ ignation .
this picture by María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government &apos;s request by the opposition to a referendum on a referendum was rejected , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis were going to empty as they were gathered in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recall of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central North @-@ eastern federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Member of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the decision of the government as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine was held , the referendum on ten@@ ding for many was the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly before MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the day of torture as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , were to continue blocking the referendum on office .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; Rec@@ re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , den 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , there are images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because anything else could be seen , which many national parks do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already accounts for the extent of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment procedure - which has now been shown in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado hold that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others see these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , under@@ took little against the devastating economic crisis and preferred to silence critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept family secret .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I couldn &apos;t see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ s@@ . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who is accused of ab@@ duction in 158 counts , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the scale of atro@@ cities he had seen as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him K@@ ent .
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
you are a as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended one of the ERP .
just notice that they don &apos;t have to kid@@ nap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of Argentina &apos;s Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gym again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be ok , because so my father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything was possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were par@@ ked and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked in , and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
they seldom ma@@ stered a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and pursued a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell again and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with their face - they were all tied up by hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ch quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed I was seeing the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors the civilian is Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ ch , director of La Per@@ la Memorial , passes through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils of war &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that the spo@@ ils of war are a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military signs which are fought against an enemy that has been fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , was able to participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you personally .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do this !
that is how my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes to his home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have executed people during dictatorship , but why should the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why kid@@ nap kids ?
one day my father brought a girl back home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is always something left .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought of showing my father was made during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness on his account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; allegedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me ?
I saw how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to take part in it as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I issued the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including serious , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture followed in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers in Spanish to the magnitude of judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended for the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 cas@@ u@@ alties finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , lawyer of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , to build a memorial that is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

editing the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , last month witnessed a very un@@ successful translation .
on a shield , the jap@@ an@@ ese word of the &quot; elderly mot@@ orists &quot; was fal@@ sely - perhaps but also with malicious h@@ ul@@ ls &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; terrible car drivers . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely divided in social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text she had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News talked a bit more about the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; elderly mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; fear@@ less &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , who are involved in accidents across the country , is quite a matter of concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of accidents caused by elderly people has risen during the same period .
the notably un@@ named re@@ porter published comments on the light published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to face against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo concerning the translation error received , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; aw@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; So wrong is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the Website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ tracking , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
however , some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose knowledge of English is considered the best , is made as a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
the con@@ vor@@ ed and en@@ ig@@ matic movements that arise from machine translation point out that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous as jewellery . but from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a resp@@ ectable source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
the main page of the website &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also took photos of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was sn@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked again .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant since 2014 to report protests . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission looked at it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I registered to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels .
previous research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests of certain domains are faulty .
if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds err@@ or@@ ly or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the broadcast was dis@@ continued on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , making it increasingly difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get an education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mean people who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a review of a formal , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , it is known in Paraguay that more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes over their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the cri@@ adi@@ lla is generally not silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family , who has her daughter in the belief that she can finish her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family that assimil@@ ates the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that otherwise would not get training and might even be star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they don &apos;t even know about it .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon occurred , which takes place in the secre@@ tion in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent sho@@ cks . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra struck a stick on Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply involved in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the girl &apos;s death .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a &quot; modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos was widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered than children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ e@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be ground@@ breaking - for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an story a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as man@@ power , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to go all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón when Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose to five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
Friday , for instance , cleaned the fridge , cleaned up the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she was finished with the study , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited , because she had to make dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry but didn &apos;t get unlimited food either . &quot; I could fetch more books from the ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
in some evenings , the master of the house forced Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand alongside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to not believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master had found someone to listen while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their masters feared that they would lose the education they allowed to lose again , explaining them .
it was clear , however , that she had paid for all that she had received from them with her hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing almost never talked about are bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships are formed , I distinc@@ tly felt that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and child@@ hoods in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for the sake of learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ u@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ hem@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the display again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ do@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from Paraguay &apos;s early history ) , while the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors ( the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores ) had to pay tribute to the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors in Paraguay .
the social inequality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulation regarding use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is accepted by parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be established that is t@@ asked to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this fails to do so , it could bring a punishment of up to six months &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment or a fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the draft law , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and is cens@@ ored in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video address and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not in a position to ensure regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Aman@@ i , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of this , it would be necessary for Egyptians to file information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I have no doubt about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine it so that as much as they are forci@@ bly physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislature and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and it should be ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of crime against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was fores@@ een for those who were found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish wildlife conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq

this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq work on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the larger Leop@@ ards family , who ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . all in all , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular species of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends on a big predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video concludes that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately fond of another side of her country , which is not just about war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region are set up .

six years after the ts@@ un@@ ami : the state of affairs in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate

Shi@@ zu@@ ga@@ wa was destroyed by the ts@@ un@@ ami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is still engaged in reconstruction .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ hoods Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has also experienced a nuclear accident , which is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the report from the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from the local point of view , which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the closing light at 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters ( by the way , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still to be res@@ ett@@ led into final buildings .
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such homes .
nearly 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who were resi@@ ding in homes after the disaster , were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could as@@ certain , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by the disaster , opened its doors by December 2016 , accounting for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now operational , only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agr@@ arian country .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of the farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma can be re @-@ used .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farm@@ land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers feel it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to establish a general picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she asked them about the state of reconstruction and how their emp@@ athy was changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to this article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami in the local population .
the survey provided that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed believe that still not enough has been done in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention .
as it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has reinforced its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and disa@@ strous ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to witness .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63@@ ,000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement homes .
as of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , most of the ev@@ ac@@ eres , still living in homes , older than 50 years old , are known to fail because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .

when people come across people from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be greater than common ground .
after a while , one often sees that one connects more than it appears at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , let &apos;s take a look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly linked with someone over language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after having been beaten by the police at nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was admitted to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia captured him with a bat@@ on against his head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident of the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be shown on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel for media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs rush to him shortly afterwards .
another video filmed with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while staying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he under@@ took the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined the intensive care unit after being attacked by a police officer who attacked him with a bat@@ on .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil when it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
demonstr@@ ators were deployed in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to res@@ ign against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers across the country .
once again , the Brazilian media tra@@ cked street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo directly reported on a broken glass window in order to design their titanium pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o favor@@ ed a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any kind of material damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate significance , and the typical acts of violence in the military police are covered by the head@@ lines entitled &quot; Prot@@ esters on a confrontation course with the police . &quot;
Cuba &apos;s For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular parish Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
after drow@@ ning , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding was left of steel and concrete .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uted daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who stands daily at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not uns@@ crew his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alled that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has been resist@@ ing pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church had already seen better times .

the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , the price of sugar rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound has to remain , according to the 2016 report on &quot; Agricultural Asp@@ ects &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word that he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
most of the respon@@ dents said they had the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to arrive .
it was a matter of officially written documents , which were only distinguished in terms of the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was exceeded and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of employment .
the best developed industrial area in Cuba and the most important working la@@ ver have been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the jobs and services that the plants generated in the communities in which they were present .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .

after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to disgu@@ ise it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other factories .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests brought the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to retirement at age 65 , not because it lacks strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young people use hip hop to express themselves and to get their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it through Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of traveling workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten C@@ ree communities in North @-@ Que@@ bec and then worked together with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop thus emphasizes that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the territory of the Kit@@ bu@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the teenagers did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation added , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who gave them a verse in the dialect of Eastern James Bay C@@ ree .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in a tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to keep my days on Earth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the day that you will hear our cry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also advance our youth
this is how they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the commentary section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the C@@ ree language makes a contribution to Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( as a result ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .
Fli@@ ck@@ r user sa@@ yo@@ t image .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin , san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plastic models of dishes &quot; ) are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant .
customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger Ma@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phones decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ation magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile phone @-@ stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
we also made this part for the Tokyo Exhibition .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ical .
some mobile phones and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ was@@ p is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
is there anyone who would say &quot; WO@@ W , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ? &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to un@@ pleasantly surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # by the day .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the subur@@ b of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing persons and those killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this battle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every dead body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Poli@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organized crime can not only fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how Fe@@ ar Life Chang@@ ed &quot; ) tells you exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are again preparing ourselves for the task that we have asked ourselves to go and look for graves , for the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he van@@ ished .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me as well .
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the assurance of my Father , but she doesn &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con le Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the fra@@ gil@@ ity and the leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known disease and sensational journ@@ alism for a few years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to it or consider this to be normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin insi@@ sts that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) when he is big . and it is also not normal for people to hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
it is unbelievable for me when the deaths of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; we@@ ary . &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was lo@@ oted by threats . &quot; in this she describes how armed criminals squee@@ zed money out of their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never goes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are apart , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , for they don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in these terrible days I asked myself if weeping would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the response is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation signed by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a fa@@ ther@@ er and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , which was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of mur@@ ders according to the Civil Security Council and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 mor@@ als per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that survived organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 with the aim of presenting complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages to which it is linked contain images depicting violence .
the fac@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or to expose a fake .
but how is the year after something has emerged for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to transmit trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between image and event - &quot; false descriptions &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country has been neglected for years and thereby devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to death .
officials described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theaters nearby which was full of people who watched the Football World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to be un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ably .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ gur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been taken up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the isolated Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted in a figur@@ atively way .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive usage of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ descriptions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely link the picture from DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning warning , published by the United Nations describe those who could flee , ra@@ pes , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported of the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts emerged as the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein had said that monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to portra@@ y this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not brought the picture of DR Congo into context .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false cultiv@@ ations date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ verse image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures of 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the image of DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some others have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have in@@ scri@@ bed examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which side they have been published . thus , we want to illustrate the reach more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully tra@@ cked ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country studies of false copies of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to also demonstrate for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive usage of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet which expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being persecuted , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government published a resolution on what it meant as &quot; pur@@ pos@@ eful news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
this claim , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ our kitchens that engage H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and use extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often used by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein granted his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the recently deleted , the Catholic near news site An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was put into circulation in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ke@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ dung &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo appeared , equipped with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was ev@@ aded as evidence for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages related there@@ with were not taken up in a religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam@@ ese , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums like this were translated into Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
from the Embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dist@@ anced .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also indicates , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong subjects or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to larger discussions about the silence related to the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false information and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what is actually happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of ref@@ using to recognise the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and emp@@ ower them to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss in terms of violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely impro@@ per way .
any investigation of false attri@@ butions , however , should also take into account how international they can be .

a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or at all not to translate .
these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but they all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you will find words from the V@@ ö@@ der@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Organ@@ ize your parents in recognition of how you have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels when heated in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ d@@ water and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have tro@@ dden across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the Sri L@@ ank@@ an emergency response from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge la@@ ths .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence .
the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the scale of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama Town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ding wor@@ sens the Den@@ gue fever , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on its way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are made to transport emergency supplies to the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organisations and start @-@ ups have also been able to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ia and Him@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi call app pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cad@@ ast@@ ral centre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
they also launched an &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and aid remedi@@ al measures .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust in her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next one we are gu@@ essing rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the i@@ con@@ ic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f , bound from an American flag , other gu@@ inea f@@ uns against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they de@@ hum@@ idi@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , are being de@@ mus@@ ised .
need to be de@@ mus@@ ised
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ omet@@ ri@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western concept , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , just as it was from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist ima@@ gery of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this appealing visual language is determined by the dark man you should be afraid of and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid crushed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to inter@@ ro@@ gate them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , defective narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the United States did not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women performing movements for change .
it is obvious that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been captured here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children become targets of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1,7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narrative that will help us to understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1,7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims rise to the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ racial American .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim belief and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab verses to the protection that seal the Koran and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

being a Muslim means to speak the prayers they told me when I had a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people , who - for centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable British e@@ aster Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .

it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is lie buried under the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy s@@ ows the United States and bears the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination attempt .

the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble two &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this two @-@ day basis .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim regi@@ ments that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of consistent surveillance of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ F@@ ly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we run and the bombs that we cast into Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically wrong picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 concerning evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to perform
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression that we are ste@@ aling in our news editorial offices .
at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ M@@ lim@@ mer@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they are ruling large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who have made me an absolute Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may lie , where someone is made to a &quot; different . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the Berkeley Bridge , conversations are taking place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ mi@@ cians talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people were enth@@ r@@ alled by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public imagination four decades ago even scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of becoming aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I put in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we do not have pres@@ idents to bom@@ bard the chocolate cake , while he has already broken countries and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for story@@ telling tries to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Ros@@ si , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now , despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ en@@ for@@ ce@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of major cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project the following applies :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and then explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and representation make it possible for the audience to get involved .
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is nar@@ rated in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this turn , story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ u@@ amus@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona in Zimbabwe :
after explaining the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can get in touch with T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico calls on the US to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 ; the march started in Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the neur@@ al@@ testing of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Ri@@ cos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of re@@ setting the debt have also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed remuneration corresponding to our working conditions , which operates in favour of the economy .
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the United States &quot; national sovereignty - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside imposed measures will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

artists and writers pay tribute to the work of the missing Syrian designer Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi
Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi and his wife N@@ our@@ a .
photo from the Facebook page of N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i Saf@@ adi .
the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture that will be held in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a scientist of the resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; finished books within three to five days read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive After@@ market ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the true cost associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side @-@ side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then we have no information about its current state or place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled &quot; Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; gives his friends and family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convi@@ ctions ?
since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , she had been contacted by people who imagined themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes were more pres@@ cient than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent all my life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a professor who wrote her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here &apos;s an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace ,
that any of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ la@@ im all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or forced into force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
since 2012 , the Global Vo@@ ices community calls for the release of Bass@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release from prison on previous post
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison for off@@ setting 54 million dollars .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council was presi@@ ded by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good management and immediately called for his re @-@ setting into the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many residents don &apos;t call the action good .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , abbrevi@@ ated C@@ IP ) , in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to resume its director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary proceedings against the re@@ actor .
the company apparently remained silent and made no reasonable legal steps for the application of the relevant functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , likewise decl@@ ines this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had served .
he could give paid presentations and motiv@@ ational speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is fond of paying for his silence .
resist@@ ed !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not possess any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing to return to the state and to serve the state . he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , dr@@ astic and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral accounts was , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he spent 10 years and was free .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored a lot of users &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or fis@@ sur@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took its posts from the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; the &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ atory con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; is usually associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech .
the context is important and # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about their use were cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , stool is written in Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; such :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before solving all the posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words next to it .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech receive quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dissemin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and the li@@ king , posting and sharing of content was prohibited for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese internet community to ask advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring more hatred within the different communities .
it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have prohibited words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship provided a great deal of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that have not contained a hate speech but still have been removed :

in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have been using social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the commun@@ es in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have been better to look at the context rather than code @-@ concentrating initiatives and learn from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided on a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the inter @-@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere , since age does not determine maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Child &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; every man under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the percentage of children who were married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements seeking to abol@@ ish laws for child@@ birth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
however , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dam@@ n themselves , take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition created tension in this actually un@@ complicated situation , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one , which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not one against it .
after having decided in the Senate before , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws of child@@ care had finally been changed .
Lov@@ ell Francis , a Facebook member of the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and it is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it took a long time to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Her@@ vor@@ ing News !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who openly stated how important is the adoption of the law , noted :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years independently of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the amend@@ ment of the married law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present during the vote .
all parliam@@ ent@@ arians , who were present , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer permitted by law .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing par@@ atro@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed , and he seems to replace his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so generally , in a way that only encourages panic and anger , would simply talk about that the state , which protects our daughters from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legally or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .

on Sunday morning the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again .
on January 18 , 2012 , the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was shown public@@ ally with the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the USA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both the students and the re@@ porters and the fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform is still locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , in spite of the legal prohibition , can be accessed .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
since we have heard the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the content in a distributed and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , which is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the barrier .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ p .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices Member and collabor@@ ators at Moz@@ illa in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia , even if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ se rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I was just resting at home when I suddenly called Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood already face to face with tig@@ ers , saying ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for initiative &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ tern at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
check out some of these photos below .

years after the marriage , Indian women dare to speak the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was re@@ published as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should ignore the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a mock @-@ up court and expelled from her family and the village community after calling a married relative with her name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city &apos;s main conversation .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the fin@@ eness of the patri@@ archy .
as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al Camp@@ a@@ ign , operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s marriage through to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and leads these clubs .
she reports on how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time they have become ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to speak lou@@ dly the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom , which they all maintain du@@ ti@@ fully and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini points out :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started his first discussion with this confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking down a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so timi@@ d that she chu@@ ck@@ led just in front of herself throughout the exercise ; another decided to let the entire fru@@ stration come out against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received numerous reports .
the husband of a woman called Ra@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was frigh@@ tened and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that indicates the mar@@ ital status :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced @-@ red dot if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing him .
the other women have not finished completely with it , but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange views and targets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a trip to every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties were tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion panel , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ sa @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , morality combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini adorned their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ inhibit@@ ors ) in a discussion round , so that women could wear it .
next they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion lu@@ b , Roh@@ ini once again confirms that things are slowly coming into play :
we have only done small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of their husband .
some , including myself , do it yet , but only if they are alone and are not other members of the family .
only one or two women continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that there is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports to other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on 29th June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend by the h@@ ash@@ tag , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit in 2016 :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this has been enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here have become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan .
also today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese Central Schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places connected with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , this is your 5 places you absolutely need to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of marketing technology , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
and what could it be for one day ?
today I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald individuals for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for dis@@ believing purpose , wor@@ rying the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently the organs of Sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there was the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokesperson at Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia explained to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police cau@@ tioned according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police already follows the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of its organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power generating wealth .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers &apos; poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , TH@@ AT shame A country where the people would be ashamed to demand sex for good grades , and encourage students to earn their bread , a country where people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald people are hun@@ ted for succ@@ eed@@ ing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of them missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ ets that both the chief of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a District , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both bald heads are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim authorities are very concerned about the murder of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known and loved him .
pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding the public &apos;s access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sels wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who out@@ source themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but they gave no further information .
Bas@@ sels &apos;s stay and constitution remained unknown until today ( August 1 , 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work is the pioneer of the Open Web @-@ movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we honor the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , thus the organisation of the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , not less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Lo@@ cking ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us case &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and a spokes@@ man says that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some reactions from abroad .
United Nations Con@@ united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was imp@@ acted after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the production of salmon to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union ( European Union )
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an Declaration on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be able to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans would like him to have the possibility of treatment abroad so that he could help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities called on the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the US embassy asked an angry response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the following to the couple :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources in Peking of the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns whether the host could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to contact with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says more :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada is ur@@ ging China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and allow for the exercise of these rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
in a declaration on 29 June , France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs sum@@ mon@@ ed China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information out if France will eventually accept it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of Political Affairs in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual le@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in an explanation on June 28 about Li@@ u and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u Well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what makes most people commit mistakes .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal &apos; countries , given that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , both cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , aband@@ oning the distorted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our dict@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged the corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equally important even if we enjoy free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw for decades a party ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as the leader of an approaching generation makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review destro@@ ys the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; faith@@ fully commit a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both country and city .
since it plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious significance .
why do the people of Singapur do their military service , do they only defend their city , but not their country ?
who must pay back our Prime Minister &apos;s bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , but that is not entirely correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of defending the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadi@@ ans &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuing series , with the rum@@ ors spread over certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et shall be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question I asked most about in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook with anger when they are held for Americans but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little that separates us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ...
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we evi@@ dently often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means being idle - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian double @-@ worker ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major feature of the Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm hearted , open kindness , which I now associate with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau found the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , released a music video that par@@ o@@ dates the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour depic@@ ts a young man who tells him what directions his girlfriend does .
although not politically , the music video relates indirectly to the military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video about the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the position of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video that refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 Rules of Girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army an absolute decision on important national issues .
the el@@ event@@ h rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; alter@@ ation &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics of the Jun@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , which monitors online content and prosec@@ utes people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand is a stri@@ k@@ ingly inc@@ ited against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warn them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payments .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before they are brought to an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the band &apos;s te@@ aser presented members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in east @-@ west Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war has officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ ar@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chil@@ ava are located in the basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ yss@@ inia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today only a few hundred people are living in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do we talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which still houses one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother allowed us to be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighbourhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers are trying to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; she calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s dialogue partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Suk@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it rather has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a young boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure trouble in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is managing a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken has been published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in a ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , tell Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you mother Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , she bu@@ ys drugs that they cannot afford , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy grew weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells si@@ m cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he says smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they left to greet her or report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez is well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that in Honduras , with his wife and three children , he fled from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him its roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , the travellers always consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grandmother she smoo@@ thes in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair pla@@ sters that she has made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces it to me shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users has been calling for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on 10 July , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after installing the app , had messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wa@@ g &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme quot@@ ations and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which was based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , presented photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen random@@ ly checked the residents whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ h make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected in a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices designed for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the control technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China , &quot; as well as a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , resulting from the fact that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system , thus providing un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents .
all branches of government , government and party related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the orders of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , a US human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is &apos;s three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ishments for a number of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Dre@@ ams or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both inside and outside .
one that makes all glory to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow any metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out to death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are imprisoned here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone to stone .
they have det@@ ained me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security minister formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest such as we@@ eds .
it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cries .
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , just my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put any high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a splendid picture that filled my expectations fully and fully .
in such a moment , you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I do now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only courageous enough to sh@@ out if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was about my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puts him in sol@@ itary and his father right with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition lies in my nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I would like to show me all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they would have assigned me a larger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with one other prisoner , and I must immediately sit down without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating his fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell mate was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently none of the surrounding cells found a well @-@ respected middle @-@ aged man who looks like &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the complete darkness no distinctive facial features can be recognized , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which were lying on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from afar , I still hear them &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am .
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams are ring@@ ing , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their view of the world .
this is not a house here that is not a land ; it is a curse they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ ble room and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he happens to me like that .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that are dra@@ gging him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary communication tool .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
on penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to rip me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him , and you can &apos;t with@@ hold your cry .
my cries were not yet enough for him , which is why they exchanged the tube with a cable .
at my first arrest I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked as a waste collector before or whether it belonged to the standard equipment .
they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable , from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the row .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it , which is why he attacked next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity f@@ lowed my whole body , enough to feed my whole neighborhood .
my half naked body stretched out on the floor was the perfect electric conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and keep you , you are being laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always let me go .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about LG@@ BT@@ Q + community rights , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he shu@@ d@@ ders to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes even to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has been owned by them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced themselves to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ it@@ ye@@ asts ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , Rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are relevant not only in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Yemen in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version to American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refuge of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured water @-@ sol@@ dered Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has some weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ ti@@ ent hot jun@@ cture has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the fla@@ vor@@ ing of tep@@ id coffee and the sha@@ kes of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it &apos;s easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry announced the appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert .
in an interview with CN@@ N , the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should not be simply a shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflecting a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned to traditional gender standards by educ@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years Jordan has increased the number of &quot; volunteers &quot; - the in@@ official outside of Jordan .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ors in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victi@@ mi@@ zed by murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a ban against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be imprisoned for in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and the guarantee provided by the family are often necessary for women to do nothing .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been used in his country as a t@@ abo@@ o .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate from politics his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been handed down to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is again on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to later point out that his comments were torn from the context , distorted and cens@@ ored by his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions but was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is campaig@@ ning openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not dis@@ cour@@ aging Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a nineteenth century poet who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ i , who was to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , did not have anything to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of government and members of the Marshall Center , argu@@ ing that comments in social media were critical to the problems related to corruption in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ b concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
in the end H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will come closer to real and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial ways of promoting demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and re@@ port@@ edly resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the festival cars , the drums and dancing came from a time when armies from the west of Japan were mar@@ ching to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
however , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ aj@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 @-@ meter high @-@ powered car was incredible .

rarely were outward appearances and body care as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these intri@@ cate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( further videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get an education in hair@@ dressing art instead of poor advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
this is exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ kind and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ ación ( letters on reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
it was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to help their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the Treaty of Peace was so important that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bians there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal refugee camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those that need them much more urgently .
he plans to share his love with people who needed most urgently .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now need to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ kind Foundation travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done before to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and all that lies in between , &quot; said political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a co @-@ worker of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bus@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has ever written me such a beautiful thing in my life , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran across the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices , new voices
at the start of the event , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC met for a discussion .
the students were all grown up as early as war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice done on the part of the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to listen to these people who had never heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings , which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former warri@@ ors have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to resort to the weapons , lift themselves up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now set on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles along our way , but together we will overcome them .

OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legislation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago after the publication of reports that dealt with the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er@@ less men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; it threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspected qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned from the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
in the end , she moved to the USA for fear of her life .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove that shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the rounds through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was just going to fetch some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you smu@@ dge ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had taken everything with them and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right pulmon@@ ary wing .
OC Media : in which sick wings were you laid - in the men or women of women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I received threats last February .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she lay down a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark windows and a license plate with a 95 on top .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without reference , without all .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in safety just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equ@@ ation , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat@@ ting with camera , I really try to figure out how the person reminds me of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has sun@@ k in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
that &apos;s what I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they worry about the problem with the person concerned and in the end claim a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has been experienced by blood grati@@ fication .
OC Media : are there still gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not many .
if , then , especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to settle in Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ards had grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken along .
up to now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would one not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was true , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally pushed us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short T@@ ops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Justice of Sh@@ aria never even cur@@ bed me a hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; mock not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they are funny about the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long was this time of grace ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov came up with the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could sense how people in the city began to change .
who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed beforehand , gaz@@ ed at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity do you have now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I esc@@ ort them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I scra@@ ped marijuana .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ ro@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , which want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them .
the D@@ age@@ stan have which , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines , who , the Russians , also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear such things .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all because I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate among the indigenous Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability of his family to come up , like Ah@@ wa@@ zi Human Rights groups who would like to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video that was shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly cleared the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing any more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have come to light .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which the majority of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 assumed great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses to employ the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territory , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying around .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by drought in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youngsters now rose to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school , and 45 % had university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse recently . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and become so employed as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional nature &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves an inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even point out well thought @-@ out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments to me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally all be fem@@ inists .
for example , today , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms are still in place for women to come across a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced and I am double and triple . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I talk about skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; raise their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to sing to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account ine@@ qualities in her mind , which refer both to the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is a poor and margin@@ alized one in a historical context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to drive forward their ego@@ centric programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and sex , because some of them continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement dead , no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres which are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ an@@ ari@@ anism : we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped who make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , because I exist in this paradigm .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a explaining to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ borne Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ governmental organization - a subsidiary of Water@@ sheds Alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities who can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; the crying women &quot; in order to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ de in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

the following article is the shortened and edited version of article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ se . the article is part of # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , also A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s clear ad was useless .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women want to report an ad , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the hus@@ bands they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence have been reported to the law enforcement authorities .
cont@@ ent@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cs 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that does not abide any Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , inadequate implementation hits and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says my@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ gy@@ ms , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different statements and reports , which , however , do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , there were 9@@ 600 ads in the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office because of domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women were also shown here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman reported in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women are unable to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s death in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or ex @-@ partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or ex @-@ partners .
according to their estimates , a woman in Paraguay dies every ten days due to violence done by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she gave up . this should not regret it for ever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she inherited the psych@@ ic force on her side - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I never thought I would ever be victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to talk about mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing her name , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen victim to Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some blame .
Victoria San@@ tos , who doesn &apos;t come from Paraguay , fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) composed of women who are in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s case everything began with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she took a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ predictable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non@@ profits ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to declare fem@@ ini@@ d an independent criminal offen@@ se and to punish harder as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the text of the law was changed in some points , in order to also win MEPs for the law , which advoc@@ ated that the road for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be paved , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are sentenced to five years &quot; imprisonment .
the original draft plan intended to impose the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they simply want to refund and obtain a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer viewed as a normal thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever remains silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the off@@ ender being punished .
we have to report as long as the ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before that , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back .
this article is the shortened and edited version of article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ se . the article is part of # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wh@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
independent media continues to attack attacks one year after the ban of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned paper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ tant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried in court but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having ab@@ ated his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only Sultan , he has been managing the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the domination of the Sultan is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially of domestic intelligence , to limit public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , to torture and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict humanitarian and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which corruption in Oman ( absolute monarchy ) has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to bind the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure on Ju@@ dge of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a judgment in a law@@ suit .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was charged from ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS captured the deputy chief editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , is banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in front of the court in Mas@@ kat .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , in order to distur@@ b the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ence of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of the ban on publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a one @-@ year ban on the profession was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was established and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the verdict .
the Appe@@ als Chamber acqu@@ itted al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months &quot; imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also appe@@ aled the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to release Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information , personally signed a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister ordered another appeal against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ establish the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
other violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exer@@ tion of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R , calls on the Italian authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , ensuring that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investments in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists is helping establish own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for the Research of Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what are the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be the recipient instead of being a mo@@ ver .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you previously did not have ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here .
the system that magazines can only make articles available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental issues around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in outer space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work has been limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
the patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds salad , but he needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der in a river is lying around which I have to pump up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far .
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new variety of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the characteristics have already been patented . &quot; he continues to make it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT @-@ area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit that others can freely use the seeds they have bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties and not to sow it right away - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
seeds therefore play a role in large gather@@ ings such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , whose recent examples are the amal@@ gam@@ ations of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which are offered in August and September 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available , in contrast to patent seed and plant traits .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all box features are protected as a intellectual property , making it difficult for plant breeders at all or only to be har@@ n@@ essed .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that en masse attached plants such as wheat are in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a Ques@@ tion of Visi@@ bility
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and are able to withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material dimin@@ ishes more and more patents for breeders . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ tive due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture , the company is setting itself for the preservation of genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property uphol@@ ds other breeders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
in other words , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees that different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make farmers work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant traits : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , most smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject patents or they keep it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton is also the opinion that breeders would innov@@ ate by avoiding plant pat@@ ents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it easy to make my opinion very simple . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is introducing an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . the centre is working with farmers to preserve the seed &apos;s traditional crop varieties and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ en@@ l works on an open @-@ source license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os held a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , declares that the organization is currently building a world @-@ wide alliance for open source seed systems , for which the official start @-@ up should be scheduled next year .
an association of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a link that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest destinations of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5th August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported the above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law in this part of the world and to give victims a voice . although it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures has fallen victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
apart from AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible web pages and media .
now the blog he instructed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was itself the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , who is also a provider of Zi@@ adas blog , is available on the other hand .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and took a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s blocking and reflected what it means for him :
blocking the blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and although blocking the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is nevertheless for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege , an arrest , a attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blog as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I did not write for nothing . in other words , my words have an influence , even if only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked from 24th May to 0@@ 6th August 133 web sites . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of vendors , by b@@ yp@@ assing inter@@ net cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) .
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the block of web sites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content onto which Egyptian users may have access .
the situation is further ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can act against these acts in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are quar@@ rel@@ ing .

day after day newspapers report in Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , marine and air port to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violent wave reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
the newspaper &quot; Extra , &quot; known for detailed coverage of violence in Rio , published the editorial , &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civil@@ ised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 territories controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoot and then ask questions to cover up .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is justified .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

calling Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mor@@ als per state , Rio is at number 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for many years .
these security policy measures also included the creation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police force and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease in violent deaths . for several years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not match the criteria set forth by the Geneva Convention for the designation &quot; Civil War . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for the people .
this demands the state to use resources and means that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an imper@@ missible aspect in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police cl@@ apped up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a police officer .
in the midst of all this violence this incident made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : trained Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities are under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , causing residents to depend on locally produced food or through tunnels and control points .
due to the many years of block@@ ade , traditional foods , such as meat , have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as how to plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the common foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can be planted in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years he has been fighting to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is now becoming more and more known . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of this writing , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are made of plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and 70 were injured as a result of the fires of the 15th and 16th of October . this resulted in the last week of solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also registered in Gali@@ cia in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
throughout Portugal , in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some images shared by Twitter users :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ gos@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow for better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ eig@@ le of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal , the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o explained :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do so : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the form of a forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val carries on in the same article of the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of light @-@ flamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind .
these problems add that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ ed@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers were not able to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .

the journey from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated by the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
right at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
at dawn , the boy was to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ le Party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his small reward and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was still characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we put nylon in front of the open windows so we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without documents in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum , A@@ shar@@ k returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disa@@ strous .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the large majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can be postpon@@ ed for months after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was A@@ shar@@ af too .
but his un@@ brid@@ led life of life helped A@@ shar@@ k to free himself from these conditions .
after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put all of his savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , several Afgh@@ ans have ar@@ isen , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells of the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the story of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals range far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily , if I know my people are suffering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey by itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ne@@ tizen report : law@@ makers from Egypt allow shut down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the evi@@ ction of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the removal of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government agency .
users would need to be able to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their identification number .
whoever fails to take this step may be sentenced to a prison term of up to six months or a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was promoted by 60 members of Parliament , is currently in progress with the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another MP filed a legislative proposal in May in which harder sanctions would be implemented for the insul@@ t of the President or a senior official . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , such action would , however , be punished with prison and monetary terms , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is to be passed , this can mean up to three years &quot; imprisonment for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised authority over demonstr@@ ators demonstrating against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration , according to human rights groups , failed to transfer the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including weapons of arms , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a acqu@@ itted the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
listen to Tunisi@@ an activists on sc@@ anned documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was princip@@ ally inter@@ ro@@ gated to a si@@ fted plan of action . according to the plan , the President of the Republic explicitly supported the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption @-@ accused official am@@ nesty , provided they return all un@@ law@@ fully received funds .
the document published on the Na@@ wa@@ at website on April 21 th@@ rows a light on how the presidential plans to support the bill will look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the nam@@ ing of his sources by speci@@ fying Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on May 09 .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their IDs ?
according to the new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is up to now unclear how authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
will we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failed to register with the local government as the &quot; Organis@@ er of Information Distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government is carrying out a list of online services that &quot; organize the publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites are currently web sites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ lat@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to er@@ ase two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry for Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it became &quot; an information source working with groups to insti@@ gate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , apart from among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week &apos;s si@@ fted documents , Britain &apos;s government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install a system that encryp@@ ts data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal , but with@@ drew other technology companies and civilian populations outside .
despite all this , the consultation will continue until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
