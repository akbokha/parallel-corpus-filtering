<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors, and practised his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "according to Method Man," "" "" "" "I was like this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I've ever lived in whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stays behind the mountain with his opinion, as one says so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and consented to him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in republican preselection was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever achieved.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that welcomes people from all over the world, a deeply believing human with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Trump Weltanschauung also agreed not with the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the Phoenix Suns in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for the environment for her lifetime, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wiser advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied in them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump suspected his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, it offered me a foothold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Arranging people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears are not taken into account by the hectic changes in their churches.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those electors, most of whom know, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (reminiscent of the White against all the other ethnic groups, "white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, which means so much like slingshot trauma), as the Great Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has done so spectacularly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyans, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere else be possible anywhere in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election of Donald Trumps, a huge portion of the White American promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "Mr. Khan asked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" ""! "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded by saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was pleased sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That's Trump Land now, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province have in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateurah?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music that is played at both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a number of years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest to the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with gleaming eyes and playing in the hustle you learn day after day trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateurura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateurura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio Chávez have begun to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums all of which were made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local economist and music teacher of the children of Cateurura, remembers the beginning time:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no room to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had been shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing on instruments made of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "a documentary called" "" "" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateurura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa was looking for.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilized against the ship. they refused to fire one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to stay," "" "" "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillaging the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and support each other where it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the slug tempo, with information between individual countries, the actions are happening nowadays in real time, with traceability on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for authorities to flag ships fishing in forbidden areas. also, suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship puts its caught fish on its way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports on the basis of this information. this means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions like sailing under false flag, fake licence documents, specifying fantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you systematically exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "" "" "" "says Long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "but another country could say" "" "" "" "Come to Me" "" "" "". "" "" "" "" "and this legal loophole is now trying to close FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">As a result of his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crimes, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">For example, some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, which cannot be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information with each other. FISH-i aims to help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the oceanfront organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed globally via the position of each tractable vessel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"get together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," he says. "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fished without license and had little to reckon with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile posted a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats purchase more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "" "" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "" "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "" "" "we are a study object." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015 six countries joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, following exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With security, the aim is to make even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia reported its first big triumph: in October, it launched Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship traveling without licence and were used towing nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was still penetrated into forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" with the taking of measures against Greko 1 they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the ocean.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are protesting against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President Nicolás Maduro's resignation.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture by María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government's request by the opposition to a referendum on a referendum was rejected, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis were going to empty as they were gathered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recall of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country, including in the lowland region of Barinas, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central North-eastern federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current president Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the holding of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Member of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the decision of the government as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine was held, the referendum on tending for many was the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly before MUD (approximately: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the day of torture as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government seat, were to continue blocking the referendum on office.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, there are images that tell of disputes, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves hit the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">The demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because anything else could be seen, which many national parks do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already accounts for the extent of oppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an impeachment procedure - which has now been shown in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptable version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was originally published on August 23, 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities committed in La Perla, a secret prison in Córdoba, Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations at La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15 one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I couldn't see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeams. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of abduction in 158 counts, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the scale of atrocities he had seen as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him Kent.</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are a asshole, you have befriended one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Just notice that they don't have to kidnap you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of Argentina's Revolutionary Workers "Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">So he forbade me to go back to the gym again. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be ok, because so my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all sorts of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla, everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - everything was possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were parked and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I looked in, and saw a couch where people were tortured." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a cot and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="241">They seldom mastered a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and pursued a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was appalling... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell again and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need.</seg>

<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay down with their face - they were all tied up by hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="270">But when I was in the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that the spoils of war are a bayonet, or perhaps military signs which are fought against an enemy that has been fought.</seg>

<seg id="346">Editing the original photo by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving licence, last month witnessed a very unsuccessful translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a shield, the japanese word of the "elderly motorists" was falsely - perhaps but also with malicious hulls & # 8212; translated as "terrible car drivers."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Original photo by Joshua Levine, widely divided in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-based daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "Holmes said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the more appropriate "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police prefecture of Kyoto apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text she had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt insulted by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "" "" "said the police." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News talked a bit more about the phenomenon of "terrible" elderly motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "fearless" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the share of older drivers, who are involved in accidents across the country, is quite a matter of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this equates to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of accidents caused by elderly people has risen during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The notably unnamed reporter published comments on the light published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese seem to face against older drivers:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-tracking, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">However, some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose knowledge of English is considered the best, is made as a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The convored and enigmatic movements that arise from machine translation point out that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least innocuous as jewellery. but from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a respectable source for their translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">The main page of the website "Navegar of Libertad" (Free Surfing) of IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also took photos of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was snapped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are locked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezolans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant since 2014 to report protests. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission looked at it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels I registered to @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests of certain domains are faulty.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a Web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds errorly or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third closed channel, the broadcast was discontinued on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates internet connections, making it increasingly difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>

<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money passes over their underage son or their underage daughter to another richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated to the criadilla is generally not silent.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent shocks. shortly after she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck a stick on Marín as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply involved in the paraguayan society of the Criadazgo for the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as a "modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos was widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered than children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>

<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as manpower, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years in order to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a state-of-the-art prefecture in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture has also experienced a nuclear accident, which is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The report from the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from the local point of view, which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement homes were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the closing light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of temporary shelters (by the way, Kazetsu juutaku) is still to be resettled into final buildings.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuation of Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were residing in homes after the disaster, were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could ascertain, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by the disaster, opened its doors by December 2016, accounting for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now operational, only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three prefectures of the agrarian country.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land, whereby only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of the farmland in Fukushima can be re-used.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of farmland destroyed by Fukushima are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers feel it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to establish a general picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked them about the state of reconstruction and how their empathy was changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to this article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami in the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey provided that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed believe that still not enough has been done in catastrophes prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has reinforced its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and disastrous tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to witness.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes, most of the evaceres, still living in homes, older than 50 years old, are known to fail because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma.</seg>

<seg id="599">The local journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a baton. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident of the active ministry.</seg>

<seg id="603">If a police officer would be beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be shown on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>

<seg id="618">This also includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers across the country.</seg>

<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo favored a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a specific cause.</seg>

<seg id="625">Cuba's Forgotten Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular parish Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After drowning, the sugar cane industry was still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding was left of steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuted daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who stands daily at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not unscrew his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long inactive time, because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalled that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has been resisting plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church had already seen better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the price of sugar rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound has to remain, according to the 2016 report on "Agricultural Aspects" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "" "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word that he repeats most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Most of the respondents said they had the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to arrive.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially written documents, which were only distinguished in terms of the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was exceeded and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years, and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, awaits the retirement in another facility, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it through Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of traveling workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree communities in North-Quebec and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus emphasizes that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the territory of the Kitbukalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the teenagers did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation added, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop-Group, who gave them a verse in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in a transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the day that you will hear our cry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also advance our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and advocate of the Cree language makes a contribution to Kevin Brousseau and adds the verse to syllables (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, close to the entrance shokuhin, sanpuru ("Plastic models of dishes") are exhibited by any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers are looking at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger Mainii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phones decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shokuhin refrigeration magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile phone-stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo Exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or Lachswasp is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say "WOW, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to unpleasantly surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be seen under: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter on Twitter the hashtag # by the day.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the suburb of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing persons and those killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this battle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the congregations that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every dead body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Poliítico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking") to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime can not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how Fear Life Changed") tells you exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez who lost her father, her four brothers, her husband and two of her nephews on just one day.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need to show not only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known disease and sensational journalism for a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to it or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin insists that he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is big. and it is also not normal for people to hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">It is unbelievable for me when the deaths of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were "weary."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family was looted by threats." in this she describes how armed criminals squeezed money out of their business for month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never goes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are apart, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want the others to be arrested, for they don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself if weeping would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the response is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "" "" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation signed by violence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherer and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, which was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murders according to the Civil Security Council and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 morals per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that survived organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015 with the aim of presenting complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" by Flickr user Niklas Wikström (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this article and the pages to which it is linked contain images depicting violence.</seg>
<seg id="818">The factencheck is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or to expose a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has emerged for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misleading to transmit tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false link between image and event - "false descriptions" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country has been neglected for years and thereby devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to death.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theaters nearby which was full of people who watched the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated to be unrecognizably.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the gruesome scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the isolated Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "" "" "said a Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted in a figuratively way.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the potential extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive usage of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of misdescriptions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely link the picture from DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning warning, published by the United Nations describe those who could flee, rapes, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported of the violence against Rohingya, Posts emerged as the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, falsely claimed that President Myanmar's Thein had said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to portray this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong subjects or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to larger discussions about the silence related to the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false information and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what is actually happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of refusing to recognise the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images sensitize readers and viewers and empower them to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss in terms of violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely improper way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false attributions, however, should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) makes every effort to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world that are difficult or at all not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But they all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you will find words from the Vöderlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Organize your parents in recognition of how you have strived for you in your younger years.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for storytelling tries to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now, despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unenforceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "" "" "while" listening "" "" "" "" often associated with understanding "" "" "" "" these events instead "" "" "" "" listen to feel, touch. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and then explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation make it possible for the audience to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is narrated in the language of Dafing. during this turn, storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamuamusara tells the tale of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona in Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the importance of his fable, John Nyamus ara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide grin, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can get in touch with TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place at 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017; the march started in Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture that will be held in Berlin, devoted an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Aftermarket).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available royalty-free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what the true cost associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side-side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "since then we have no information about its current state or place of residence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled "Collective Remembrance" gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">Since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel" had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, she had been contacted by people who imagined themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes were more prescient than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to extinguish this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent all my life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am overwhelmed when I call his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a professor who wrote her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption convicted director after release from prison on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for offsetting 54 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council was presided by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good management and immediately called for his re-setting into the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic who rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents don't call the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, abbreviated CIP), in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to resume its director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system," "" "" "" "the CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary proceedings against the reactor.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and made no reasonable legal steps for the application of the relevant functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the Mozambican social media, likewise declines this behavior and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid presentations and motivational speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is fond of paying for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resisted!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil, says the director does not possess any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to the state and to serve the state. he has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served itself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">To be honest, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Mahel will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, drastic and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral accounts was, when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of selling also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes the tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took its posts from the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or "the" Kalar "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciatory connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'is usually associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important and # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about their use were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, stool is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboobutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' such:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before solving all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "" "" "Kalar" "" "" "" "manually." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the words next to it.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech receive quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and the liking, posting and sharing of content was prohibited for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese internet community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have prohibited words such as "chair" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship provided a great deal of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that have not contained a hate speech but still have been removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the Burmese text reads" "" "" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check if Facebook removes the mail that contains the word Kalar. "</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have been using social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat violence in the communes in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the rampant hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word "Kalar," it would have been better to look at the context rather than code-concentrating initiatives and learn from them.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously decided on a law to ban this practice, so that the age-ready age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">In May 2016, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, leader of the inter-religious organization (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country, said that the state should not interfere, since age does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Child's Rights Convention, the minors as, "every man under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the percentage of children who were married to 15, in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements seeking to abolish laws for childbirth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should, damn themselves, take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition created tension in this actually uncomplicated situation, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one, which contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After having decided in the Senate before, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws of childcare had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Lovell Francis, a Facebook member of the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the core of the matter, but do you know what? the toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and it is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was of the opinion, it took a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally came:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Hervoring News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, who openly stated how important is the adoption of the law, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years independently of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the amendment of the married law was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 were present during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All parliamentarians, who were present, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer permitted by law.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childbearing paratrodabuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take legal action, should the law be passed, and he seems to replace his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so generally, in a way that only encourages panic and anger, would simply talk about that the state, which protects our daughters from being misused by large, hard-boiled men who are in advantage of them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children are legally or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws that they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1384">On the eve of national demonstrations against corruption that coincided with the Day of Russia - the Russian National Day - the prosecutor's website was hacked by the district of Yaroslavl. hackers left a witty message "Stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"" "" "" "or we bring you to the jail instead of Dimon." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1387">At 11.15 the message was removed from the page - but it remained in the cache.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again.</seg>
<seg id="1391">On January 18, 2012, the English-language Wikipedia page was shown publically with the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both the students and the reporters and the fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform is still locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus making a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, in spite of the legal prohibition, can be accessed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Since we have heard the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the content in a distributed and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, which is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklop .org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices Member and collaborators at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was just resting at home when I suddenly called Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was, and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood already face to face with tigers, saying,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Buhek appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for initiative" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ottern at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "" "" "instead they use a pronouns or say" "" "" "" "father of my child." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should ignore the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state Odisha by a mock-up court and expelled from her family and the village community after calling a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city's main conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the fineness of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal Campaign, operated by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera in the discovery of practices such as children's marriage through to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports on how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time they have become ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak loudly the name of their husbands is a custom, which they all maintain dutifully and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini points out:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started his first discussion with this confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "" "" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking down a centuries-old tradition in which married women never dare to pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so timid that she chuckled just in front of herself throughout the exercise; another decided to let the entire frustration come out against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received numerous reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Raini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was frightened and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said," "" "" "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that indicates the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced-red dot if he did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not finished completely with it, but they think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange views and targets.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we will make a trip to every discussion club." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities were tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion panel, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people's okay, but some wanted to wear a salsa-kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morality combined with the saris and much more, Rohini adorned their own couple of Kurtas (Oberinhibitors) in a discussion round, so that women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion lub, Rohini once again confirms that things are slowly coming into play:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped saying the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it yet, but only if they are alone and are not other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at any time on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that there is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and reports to other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1583">The police of Zambézia warned the population that men-headed men could be in Mozambique's target of attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald individuals for organ trafficking, probably for disbelieving purpose, worrying the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently the organs of Shamans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There was the local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesperson at Zambézia explained to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in 2016 to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who intend to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are target of ritual attacks, the Mozambican police cautioned according to the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police already follows the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of its organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of Zambézia, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power generating wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the Bloggers' poor Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of them missed the opportunity for macabre humor.</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: citizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel Prize winner and dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (State Locking) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Lius case "an internal affair," and a spokesman says that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summed up some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations Conunited nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was impacted after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the production of salmon to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union (European Union)</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius, as stated in an Declaration on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we also expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Lius" "" "" "" "as well as family members." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told him that the Americans would like him to have the possibility of treatment abroad so that he could help him with his recovery. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities called on the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US embassy asked an angry response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Peking of the news agency Reuters reported that China had great concerns whether the host could overshadow Liu's visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to contact with someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says more:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada is urging China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and allow for the exercise of these rights" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a declaration on 29 June, France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All the necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information out if France will eventually accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Political Affairs in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual leu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very concerned in an explanation on June 28 about Liu and stated that many asked him to pray for Liu Well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what makes most people commit mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "" "" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "" "" "twist the logic" "" "" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmuamalgam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal' countries, given that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, both cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, abandoning the distorted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our dictative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged the corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequally important even if we enjoy free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw for decades a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said that" "" "" "" "Singapore is not a country," "" "" "" "he obviously did not mean in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as the leader of an approaching generation makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what awaits me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes this and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review destroys the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "faithfully commit a mistake" or was it a Freudian speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious significance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur do their military service, do they only defend their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister's bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know each other, there is little that separates us Canadians from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1779">Music video of a pop band parodized Thailands Junta</seg>
<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, released a music video that parodates the Junta, which took power in 2014 and in spite of her promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour depicts a young man who tells him what directions his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically, the music video relates indirectly to the military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video about the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1,254 times divided and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the position of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video that refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 Rules of Girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary Constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army an absolute decision on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The eleventh rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program for the "alteration" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, which monitors online content and prosecutes people accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand is a strikingly incited against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup d "état of the army.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only recovered very slowly in east-west Asia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">More than 20 years have passed since the Georgian-abchastic war has officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuaral show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and KharChilava are located in the basin of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups, such as Russians, Greeks, Abyssinia, Georgians and Armenians, lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today most of the Russians and Abchases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today only a few hundred people are living in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people, having barely increased over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1819">The empty five-storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s, called Khruchukwkas, symbolise the decline and devastation of the region.</seg>
<seg id="1820">The buildings decay and very rarely, they are inhabited by more than two families.</seg>

<seg id="1829">There were communal centres, schools and kindergartens, all of which served the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with faded splendor buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the ghost town Dzhantukha approximately fifty inhabitants live.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in other villages it looks similar.</seg>
<seg id="1834">The Khrushchev, which still houses one or two families, one recognizes at the balconies where laundry is dried.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.</seg>

<seg id="1839">The girl whispers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called Tkuarchalugol.</seg>
<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the subsistence economy (cultivation of agricultural products for self-consumption) such as cattle breeding, beekeeping and vegetable cultivation.</seg>
<seg id="1842">It is difficult to come across the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="1843">In winter, the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-colored earrings in a teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "" "" "sometimes, tell Ms. Ramírez, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call" "" "" "" "Mama Africa!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">"" "" "" "where are you mother Africa?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it's rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, she buys drugs that they cannot afford, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans often travel together and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy grew weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells sim cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he says smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests often send her text messages when they left to greet her or report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs Ramírez is well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula come from Central America and other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that in Honduras, with his wife and three children, he fled from people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, the travellers always consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she smoothes in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair plasters that she has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she introduces it to me shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats it every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users has been calling for" "" "" "" "business" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the cell phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after installing the app, had messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwag's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mainly focus on the experiences of users in major cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme quotations and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China," which was based on Twitter, published censored news in China, presented photos from a checkpoint where policemen randomly checked the residents whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjih make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected in a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices designed for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the control technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China," as well as a Jingwang product description, resulting from the fact that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system, thus providing unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Party Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, government and party related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the orders of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, a US human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis's three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a number of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2070">My cries were not yet enough for him, which is why they exchanged the tube with a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest I asked myself if the investigator had worked as a waste collector before or whether it belonged to the standard equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They intertwined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable, from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling down and did not take any pleasure in it, which is why he attacked next to an electrically charged staff.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about LGBTQ + community rights, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he shudders to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes even to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has been owned by them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced themselves to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felityeasts (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioned their old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, Racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are relevant not only in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Yemen in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by borders in his mind, and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion to American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refuge of the second generation," he calls himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "" "" "says Hdaib." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "" "" "then he adds:" "" "" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "" "" "while he poured water-soldered Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; at this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has some weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sentient hot juncture has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the flavoring of tepid coffee and the shakes of the Kent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">So it's easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry announced the appearance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">In an interview with CNN, the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said that the concert was "just" cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporter of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should not be simply a shallow rhetoric, but actually reflecting a more and more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned to traditional gender standards by educating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years Jordan has increased the number of "volunteers" - the inofficial outside of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honors in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have been victimized by murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a ban against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be imprisoned for indefinite time in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures and the guarantee provided by the family are often necessary for women to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics that have long been used in his country as a taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate from politics his music, which is full of explicit allusions on sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics has been handed down to me," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "" "" "in a song called" "" "" "" "Edward Sa'ed," "" "" "" "Hdaib takes the question of Palestinian identity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is again on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled "Santorano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to later point out that his comments were torn from the context, distorted and censored by his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions but was only a edited version," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is campaigning openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not discouraging Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a nineteenth century poet who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nui, who was to work on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, Hdaib, did not have anything to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even more recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of government and members of the Marshall Center, arguing that comments in social media were critical to the problems related to corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaib concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will come closer to real and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial ways of promoting democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and reportedly resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the festival cars, the drums and dancing came from a time when armies from the west of Japan were marching to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen organized a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been watching the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">However, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebajaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were outward appearances and body care as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens moving into the hands of hairdressers who can recreate these intricate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (further videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get an education in hairdressing art instead of poor advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the community and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the Bogotkind and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la Reconciliación (letters on reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to help their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the Treaty of Peace was so important that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombians there is still a long way to speak of genuine reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal refugee camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take in their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those that need them much more urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now need to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotkind Foundation travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done before to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and all that lies in between," said political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a co-worker of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambusches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed there was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "I said," "" "" "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "" "" "he answered," "" "" "" "I answer a letter that someone has written to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no one has ever written me such a beautiful thing in my life, so I answer it." "" "" "" "suddenly tears ran across the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices, new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start of the event, students and some leaders of the FARC met for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as early as war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice done on the part of the state to the whole Colombian people.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "one of them said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To listen to these people who had never heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated people with beautiful feelings, which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the reality in which the country lives is hurting me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to resort to the weapons, lift themselves up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we of the FARC now set on peace, on a policy without weapons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles along our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">The LGBTQ legislation in Chechnya has won the international headlines several months ago after the publication of reports that dealt with the deportation, torture and killing of queerless men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; it threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspected queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">She felt that she was a woman in reality.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had learned from the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2254">In the end, she moved to the USA for fear of her life.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a transwoman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove that shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the rounds through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was just going to fetch some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you smudge?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything with them and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right pulmonary wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which sick wings were you laid - in the men or women of women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are deprecated, there is my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I received threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family but the entire republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman but you must disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she lay down a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with dark windows and a license plate with a 95 on top.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without reference, without all.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're in safety just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equation, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera, I really try to figure out how the person reminds me of her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has sunk in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That's what I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they worry about the problem with the person concerned and in the end claim a proof that the so-called "honor" has been experienced by blood gratification.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to settle in Kadyrow's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say:" "" "" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beards had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was there when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would one not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in the whole of Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was true, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia wanted to introduce us to" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but finally pushed us back into the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Ministry of Justice of Sharia never even curbed me a hair." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "mock not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they are funny about the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long was this time of grace?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov came up with the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could sense how people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Who smiled and laughed beforehand, gazed at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, gatherings, I escort them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I scraped marijuana.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidroab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, which want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bobbins with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have which, the Cabardines, who, the Russians, also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear such things.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all because I just know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate among the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability of his family to come up, like Ahwazi Human Rights groups who would like to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video that was shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly cleared the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have come to light.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which the majority of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 assumed great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses to employ the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territory, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying around.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by drought in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youngsters now rose to 81%." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school, and 45% had university degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse recently. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and become so employed as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speaking of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, even with the intersectional nature"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves an intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even point out well thought-out scientific and societal arguments to me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally all be feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, today, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms are still in place for women to come across a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am convinced and I am double and triple." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I talk about skin color, on racism, on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet all agree that women - all women - should come together to "raise their voices" and "Kumbaya, my Lord" to sing to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account inequalities in her mind, which refer both to the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "in 1851," "" "" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "" "" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is a poor and marginalized one in a historical context." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups who also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to drive forward their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and sex, because some of them continue to hold the importance of black women for the feminist movement dead, no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres which are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanarianism: we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped who make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Curse. the article is part of # PorSerMujer (# weilicheinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for mistreatment, also Ada Báez's clear ad was useless.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women want to report an ad, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the husbands they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence have been reported to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content1 Strikes and Statistics 2 Invisible mistreatments and a legal system that does not abide any Paraguayan laws: good approach, inadequate implementation hits and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really abused, says myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Egyms, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different statements and reports, which, however, do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, there were 9600 ads in the District Attorney's Office because of domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women were also shown here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "on every woman reported in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women are unable to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "she said," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's death in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or ex-partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or ex-partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, a woman in Paraguay dies every ten days due to violence done by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does not undermine anything</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then she gave up. this should not regret it for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she inherited the psychic force on her side - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would ever be victims of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to talk about mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming her name, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen victim to Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had some blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who doesn't come from Paraguay, fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "" "" "Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network (" "" "" "" "I believe you" "" "" "" ") composed of women who are in any way victims of abuse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias's case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She took a trial against her former partner who developed into an unpredictable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, inadequate implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not applied." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "" "" "the display of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice," "" "" "" "says Victoria Santos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porelas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# Nonprofits) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to declare feminid an independent criminal offense and to punish harder as it is already in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the text of the law was changed in some points, in order to also win MEPs for the law, which advocated that the road for decriminalisation of abortions would be paved, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are sentenced to five years "imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original draft plan intended to impose the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they simply want to refund and obtain a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer viewed as a normal thing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever remains silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the offender being punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to report as long as the ill-treatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. before that, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is regarded as a great setback.</seg>
<seg id="2543">This article is the shortened and edited version of article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Curse. the article is part of # PorSerMujer (# whlicheinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media continues to attack attacks one year after the ban of a newspaper</seg>
<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this website was closed on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Information" "" "" "" "on the homepage of the banned paper Azamn." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arabic-language newspaper Azamn because of its coverage of corruption in the sultant.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he served a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried in court but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having abated his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, alongside his role as the only Sultan, he has been managing the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The domination of the Sultan is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, especially of domestic intelligence, to limit public freedoms, including freedom of the press, to torture and torture human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict humanitarian and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which corruption in Oman (absolute monarchy) has been reported since its inception in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, arrested on 26 July 2016 an article entitled "High-ranking parties to bind the judiciary." this was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials accused of having put pressure on Judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to suspend a judgment in a lawsuit.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the editorial committee, was charged from ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, ISS captured the deputy chief editor Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as chief editor after al-Maamaris arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that "the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way, including online, is banned from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial of Al-Maamari Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place in front of the court in Maskat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, among other things, in order to disturb the public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining the Presence of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of the ban on publication and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of 3000 omanic rial (7800 US dollars), and a one-year ban on the profession was imposed on both journalists.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to distribute material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For al-Abri a security deposit of 5000 omanic rial (13,000 US dollars) was established and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pronouncement of the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Chamber acquitted al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj sentenced Al-Haj to six months "imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he served his one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also appealed the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to release Azamn, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information, personally signed a further statement, in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the Minister ordered another appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal to re-establish the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other violations include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exertion of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the omanic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR, calls on the Italian authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. in all circumstances, ensuring that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work unhindered and without fear of retaliation, including judicial chicanes.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and missing investments in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists is helping establish own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for the Research of Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic first showed serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>

<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work that you previously did not have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only make articles available against payment (the so-called "paywall") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental issues around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outredgeous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in outer space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds salad, but he needs longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if a boulder in a river is lying around which I have to pump up." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new variety of lettuce because all the characteristics have already been patented. "he continues to make it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and around the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salat of the variety Outredgeous in the glasshouse of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT-area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit that others can freely use the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it in order to breed their own varieties and not to sow it right away - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds therefore play a role in large gatherings such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds, whose recent examples are the amalgamations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which are offered in August and September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available, in contrast to patent seed and plant traits.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all box features are protected as a intellectual property, making it difficult for plant breeders at all or only to be harnessed.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that en masse attached plants such as wheat are in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and are able to withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material diminishes more and more patents for breeders. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predictive due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture, the company is setting itself for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property upholds other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">In other words, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant traits: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass herbicides are needed, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is just opposite." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto) have patents, most smaller seed companies manage to survive even without patents - either they reject patents or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders would innovate by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years, "he says." with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it easy to make my opinion very simple. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is introducing an "open-source" seed programme. the centre is working with farmers to preserve the seed's traditional crop varieties and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "" "" "it also supports them to come to" "" "" "" "open source" seeds and sell their own. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreenl works on an open-source license which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos held a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed patenting.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for "Open Source" seed systems, declares that the organization is currently building a world-wide alliance for open source seed systems, for which the official start-up should be scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">An association of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest destinations of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5th August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true despite this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law in this part of the world and to give victims a voice. although it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site closures has fallen victim. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles, which he writes for in Egypt not accessible web pages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he instructed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was itself the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is also a provider of Ziadas blog, is available on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and took a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blocking and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">Blocking the blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and although blocking the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is nevertheless for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a state of siege, an arrest, a attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blog as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write for nothing. in other words, my words have an influence, even if only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now that they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked from 24th May to 06th August 133 web sites. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of vendors, by bypassing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the block of web sites that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue to block and filter content onto which Egyptian users may have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is further aggravated by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can act against these acts in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are quarreling.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers report in Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "" "" "" "thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons," "" "" "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers from the army, marine and air port to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violent wave reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The newspaper "Extra," known for detailed coverage of violence in Rio, published the editorial, "That is not normal," in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper said that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't know the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 territories controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police, who only shoot and then ask questions to cover up.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is justified.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">The state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A peace march in Niterói in Rio de Janeiro in honor of Rafael's assassinated cultural organizer.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Calling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "when we look at the morals per state, Rio is at number 16" "" "" "", "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the creation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose objective is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police force and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease in violent deaths. for several years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not match the criteria set forth by the Geneva Convention for the designation "Civil War."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This demands the state to use resources and means that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an impermissible aspect in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police clapped up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a police officer.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities are under brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack on August 21, 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are assuming the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpetrated.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, causing residents to depend on locally produced food or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the many years of blockade, traditional foods, such as meat, have become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas how to plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not among the common foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can be planted in houses and basements." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families knowledge to grow mushrooms, so Dr. Leila leads to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of this writing, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative relies on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are made of plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "" "" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started" "" "" "" "production of fungal seeds coming from regions" "" "" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and 70 were injured as a result of the fires of the 15th and 16th of October. this resulted in the last week of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forestry monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2850">In the forest of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy as in June, as the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the form of a forest reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," João Sorval carries on in the same article of the Público newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of light-flammable wood, spread like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used its own civil protection data using the application fogosed.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers were not able to withstand the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups defeated by the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Right at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't say it at that time, she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy was to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahle Party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his small reward and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The life of Afghan refugees in Iran was still characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we put nylon in front of the open windows so we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without documents in Iran and prepared for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum, Ashark returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high ratings. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unqualified personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can be postponed for months after the registration of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was Asharaf too.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbridled life of life helped Ashark to free himself from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry, Ashark put all of his savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, several Afghans have arisen, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells of the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the story of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals range far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily, if I know my people are suffering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are.</seg>

<seg id="2928">Netizen report: lawmakers from Egypt allow shut down social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the eviction of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the removal of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo courtesy of @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would need to be able to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Whoever fails to take this step may be sentenced to a prison term of up to six months or a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by 60 members of Parliament, is currently in progress with the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "another MP filed a legislative proposal in May in which harder sanctions would be implemented for the insult of the President or a senior official." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, such action would, however, be punished with prison and monetary terms, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if the law is to be passed, this can mean up to three years" imprisonment for the condemned. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised authority over demonstrators demonstrating against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested in the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration, according to human rights groups, failed to transfer the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including weapons of arms, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza acquitted the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for reporting on the pro-Morsi seat block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Listen to Tunisian activists on scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was principally interrogated to a sifted plan of action. according to the plan, the President of the Republic explicitly supported the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption-accused official amnesty, provided they return all unlawfully received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the Nawaat website on April 21 throws a light on how the presidential plans to support the bill will look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denied the naming of his sources by specifying Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which reassures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the district court in Tunis on May 09.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their IDs?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new rules of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China need permission before writing or sharing messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is up to now unclear how authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Will we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "" "" "according to Roscomnadzor," "" "" "" "WeChat" "" "" "" "failed to register with the local government as the" Organiser of Information Distribution. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government is carrying out a list of online services that "organize the publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force it on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently web sites such as Vkontakte and Odnolatniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has locking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blocking Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to erase two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry for Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was closed because it became "an information source working with groups to instigate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, apart from among other things, China, one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week's sifted documents, Britain's government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install a system that encrypts data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal, but withdrew other technology companies and civilian populations outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation will continue until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
