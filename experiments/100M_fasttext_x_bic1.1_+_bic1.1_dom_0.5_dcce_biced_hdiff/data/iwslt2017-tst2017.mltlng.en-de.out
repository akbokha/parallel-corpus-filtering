this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation where the CIA literally sur@@ rendered to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the US government .
for nearly 10 years , the government determined against Ris@@ en and called on him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en was living with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
all of a sudden , although they had indications for years that it would be essential to their case , the demands of the government were dropped at Ris@@ en .
the reason for this is that in time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of separating and ris@@ king statements , this could also take care of his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly listened to his phone calls ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his loan , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more condem@@ nation than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more options to spy on all .
but just as the government allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press may also use technologies to better protect its sources .
they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software , which has not yet existed as Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer store information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility of assign@@ ing mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers ,
who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental employee who raises alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; contained &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to make a statement . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Fon@@ sec@@ a Mos@@ sack and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trail of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nerv@@ ously waiting for the next release , and on the next unveiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent ri@@ ll@@ ers or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years now .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because until now there were no prominent Americans who came into these revelations expos@@ ing this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but due to the principle behind these tax ha@@ v@@ ens , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to give less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
fraud has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable depos@@ itors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that all except one attorney made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single peak politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to handle this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
it may sound very mur@@ ky as though we could do nothing against it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that a lot has begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen advances to more transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the issue took political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is la@@ gging behind .
representatives of both parties have proposed a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bo@@ g@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advoc@@ ate to end this type of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I lost there ?
a wild alien sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at the toes to the door , and shut my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate is drawing off and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer @-@ bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure that our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red the whole city with them . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ hin@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could create a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
through the internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to light .
but they do not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you concentrate on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Art , we had learned that design is much more than just looks and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
place your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this soft touch of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in his hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you announce on Twitter that he is running for President &apos;s Office ?
you can now return your mobile phones back .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had said where he was coming from , how would his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well sprung mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
we trust the people most often , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimum degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on how to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need not covered beforehand .
for us , business is running very well .
of course there are times when everything is not going smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood in front of the front when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts already when I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction has ever had a problem .
for men have confidence in one another .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
they drive one in their own car to the hospital , when one dies , and wait while one gets a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
you can stay even longer without charging the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay happens .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what we want to achieve with the share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing come together with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
but to call it just the &quot; rental industry , &quot; the matter does not do justice .
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people share a part of themselves openly , and this changes everything .
it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic for that .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group there would be waiting to fill up a thoroughly and show one at a pub @-@ hair@@ cut , of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children had moved out . incub@@ ator programs were initiated ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why exactly did it work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or just a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim yet : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot @-@ like fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , Baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ te me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : back then it was a feminist declaration of independence , against the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I did not only passi@@ vely accept the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thinking , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; Eil@@ een . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into revol@@ t .
why should one do such a thing ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... Ji@@ had ... ... &quot; ... bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others transformed from one side@@ walk into susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA in order to move to a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- as we drove in silence -- as deep as it went down into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be slow@@ ed down . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gging and beating .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have got the anger of the people on terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when will we go ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the US body .
the only question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is er@@ ron@@ eous .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there may be some parking spaces available , but not stop terror .
regular visits to a mos@@ que lead to people of other fai@@ ths more tolerant and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me : people are actually not being radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS justi@@ fies its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imag@@ inations by acknowled@@ ging them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups maintain their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when one looks at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which allows them to read these things in the Scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke brought them to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main objective of the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive aven@@ ues for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if one puts out test subjects in which neg@@ atively reported about Muslims , they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood sw@@ elled up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when assign@@ ing collective guilt it is not just about self @-@ explaining .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the dental department , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , the most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has I become such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw left me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled men were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment , I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join those who think that we are better than those . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you so much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a class@@ y think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
hi : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion @-@ dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air package delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1,@@ 500 tiles live in front of the public . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ resist@@ able structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our lab at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are external commands on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear star@@ starter ,
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . that &apos;s okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the matter .
for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts , which meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
even though it is mechanical , very much happens in the interior , so that it can fly stable , and can move everywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ op@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
you can see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , it receives the most extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is directed or even rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let us look at this .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller is out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic heat .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated entities enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we accepted standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe press there would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the reward is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form it in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
about 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns transm@@ uted into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
some 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized her as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometric @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance tremend@@ ously .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes ro@@ amed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their observations like lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a wave of gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ attering in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and moved into the other .
for illustration , lec@@ turers teach in the theory of rel@@ ativity quite elo@@ qu@@ ent dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched when the waves were hit . an average man &apos;s el@@ ong@@ ation was 10 high - 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . for this reason , the Lig@@ o staff declared ins@@ ane .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous .
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
when it comes to sounds , it &apos;s different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face , for example .
instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob is breaking them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we transform wave pattern into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak literally .
listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply circul@@ ate : w@@ up@@ p !
the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . this is done in this way : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu .
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14th 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; Any@@ one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ times solar mass , which rotate about as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let us think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we &apos;ve heard it .
in this there is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as never before .
on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or fundamentally -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ a .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about them all .
the exciting physical processes , however , occur in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are op@@ ak .
the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own rear light .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we have no idea at all . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the formation of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
please do not hesitate to contact us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say yes .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I start playing the show ?
no , no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my fear to keep talking , my social fear -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pu@@ ff , gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , in an unexpected way . it began with a question of my little ones .
I have three unbelievable daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is called all &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons .
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very happy .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has a striking side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ telling of playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things look like you are contempl@@ ating life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I &apos;m making television , in a grand style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programmes , 70 hours of TV , three programmes that are simultaneously in production four times , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not just produced , so still on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who else is doing that ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I say it to you that all of you who work so hard whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just typing on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as if I painted on a canvas .
as if you had a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the h@@ um .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy road , I could go to it forever .
many people accept when I declare the sums to them that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the h@@ um -- when I began to work and work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the h@@ um !
the tot@@ um is more than writing .
the tot@@ um is action and activity . the tot@@ um is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you can &apos;t asp@@ ire anything other than great@@ ness .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size , no matter what price .
this is called bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I &apos;m not do@@ omed to fail , and I just know that I love the h@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more I become , the more shows , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um .
I like this sum . I love the h@@ um .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ loaded , over@@ driven , burnt out .
the tot@@ em stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single work title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ um ceased .
the engine bu@@ zz@@ ing was silent .
I didn &apos;t really love my work anymore .
the tot@@ um did not come back .
my sum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no h@@ um .
there was silence in me .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a demonstration Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the h@@ um and the h@@ um I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly f@@ ading the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ c@@ ise you , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you do , you do , you love what you do , to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when I become aware of two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz is bet@@ ting , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sums , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; lets go .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes and an energy boost comes in .
and this doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens .
I feel it .
the tot@@ um comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay at the point .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the tot@@ um , the working h@@ um , the titanium um , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of programmes and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are .
the tot@@ um is no force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum of money depends on love .
the h@@ um is the current that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to experience , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums are simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for what God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the tot@@ em again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good at playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not ans@@ wer@@ able to me as much as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what is better for a man than to be at home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
we ro@@ de around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play Ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always resort to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ um of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaced me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and talking my teen@@ age daughter with me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can take 15 minutes a day , even in a bad mood !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children make ready .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well@@ feeling , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ als , to have a place for their peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll make a difference and I die . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on a piece , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the h@@ um came back in my spare time . the h@@ um then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy comes in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the h@@ um is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but only a part . and for that I am so grateful .
it is snow@@ ing to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan yet , the trip to Jerusalem is playing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Yes to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I create is the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the tot@@ um , the tot@@ um , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel the tot@@ em , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things like that , I catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of that job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability .
that is why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
FAQ What is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a physician who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions .
in the process , one of the most well @-@ known is called &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; one electrode is im@@ planted in the brain deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room .
I often supplied patients with a skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that the brain s@@ wel@@ ds and the cran@@ ial pressure increases in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas .
to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your family .
you have to find the right food , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to make it prosp@@ er .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw that under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like stem cell culture . large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they constitute 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the embry@@ onic stage , they are responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is , however , clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did by Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last step we re @-@ introduced them to the est@@ ran@@ gement of the same individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ neur@@ on transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ ar these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ enter the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared as if they had been removed again , they go back home .
in the second scenario we added a injury to and reim@@ ported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ed@@ .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we color in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we used the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
look now , when we reim@@ plant@@ ed@@ the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , it &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is beneficial to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his major im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence austerity programs that were implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you to an economical model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe once again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ umb to a false belief , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mol@@ ested , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
I would like to draw you attention to an interesting contradiction that threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin Summit @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the debt mountain ,
but few know his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , but they are too afraid to invest where it would be productive and generate income with which one could bear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example , green energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
$ 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money , until we compare it to the $ 5.1 billi@@ on@@ lion dollar , which was around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and boost real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that do not balance through the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and hence low macro@@ economic demand , which like in an infinite loop encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who do not invest .
un@@ intentionally causing the circumstances causing O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my quar@@ rel with capitalism --
his exceedingly extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the Earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy closed too many .
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
it would , however , be a mistake to reduce the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy as a result of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but also more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voice @-@ wei@@ ghting in questions of the state stocks .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle , which illumin@@ ates very bright , it is burned out quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy only came when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two by gradually under@@ mining politics and alien@@ ating them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power , because the power has been diver@@ ted from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my quar@@ rel with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors that have decim@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , so that it star@@ ves at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality rises , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea , by the way .
the Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very well received .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation makes the twin peaks higher , the wast@@ efulness more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has brought forth .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the business area , please introduce yourself to a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues deri@@ ve from capital and from revenues , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises , but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely moving exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency presented by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; into units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a united policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as a liberal Marxist in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ union of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive reduction in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next thing we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m also perfect .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not s@@ wir@@ led , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : that &apos;s a very Greek one , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while in the area where most of it plays out -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in some ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stu@@ art Mill
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can see now in China resembles the very development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now is to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Greece &apos;s Finance Minister at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back on the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the constant den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the Eurozone , and continues to continue , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if you try to keep an economic system that is not viable by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes happen , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ous ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such an ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to case only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been carrying out a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most have never heard of it , even though he is probably responsible for 22 mid @-@ minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , sli@@ mmer , has a hair@@ cut and refers to Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t pick any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are at the very right of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this assessment .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the turn .
Roy Price is not concerned with getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average bul@@ lying , the average television -- the shows that are neither good or bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price wants to risk nothing .
he wants to create success .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a contest .
he takes up a lot of ideas for TV shows and picks up eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch for free .
and when Amazon comes out for nothing , do you access right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump or look at again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data what kind of show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four repub@@ li@@ can U.S. channels . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something about the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of organising a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the pieces together they entered a carriage and decided not to make a sit@@ com about four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this turn . so exactly where they want to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
when you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computers .
the least what you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work that way , this is a little frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond the television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . if you come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , it can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it was possible to predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad type , by data analysis of the Google research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly year by year , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore .
and nobody could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these mistakes , data constantly flo@@ ats into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use a lot of data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its individual parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again in order to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , which they wouldn &apos;t have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they comp@@ eted for TV ideas than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what the data tell us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data starts to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , as you naturally know , when you have the data available , you want to replace it with a much wis@@ er tool such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the huge amount of data it still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
