<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation where the CIA literally surrendered to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government determined against Risen and called on him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of a sudden, although they had indications for years that it would be essential to their case, the demands of the government were dropped at Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason for this is that in time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of separating and risking statements, this could also take care of his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so investigators, without his consent, have secretly listened to his phone calls,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his loan, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has more condemnation than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive, because the government has more and more options to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press may also use technologies to better protect its sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software, which has not yet existed as Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer store information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have the possibility of assigning misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to know about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental employee who raises alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] contained [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to make a statement.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Fonseca Mossack and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox offices in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trail of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervously waiting for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent rillers or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years now.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoshka.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because until now there were no prominent Americans who came into these revelations exposing this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle behind these tax havens, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states there is less information needed to give less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraud has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable depositors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked us that all except one attorney made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's not about a single peak politician involved in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and to handle this, we need to change the rules of the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very murky as though we could do nothing against it, as if nothing had ever changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen advances to more transparency concerning the owners of companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The issue took political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "since then, the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have proposed a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advocate to end this type of intransparency by laws." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally end the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "" "" "and I thought," "" "" "" "Oh, man!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard me say:" "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "a voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Well, how please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I lost there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "what if he's crazy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaked at the toes to the door, and shut my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate is drawing off and the rent is increased." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer-bed-and-breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure that our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured the whole city with them. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blehinczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could create a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to light.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you concentrate on the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art, we had learned that design is much more than just looks and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Place your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he is running for President's Office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return your mobile phones back.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had first introduced himself to his name; if he had said where he was coming from, how would his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really hold on very well sprung mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest left their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most often, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that confidence is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "" "" "Hi!" "" "" "" "you don't get an answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "tell too much, for example:" "" "" "" "I have problems with my mother," "" "" "" -- -- -- the request is also rather not accepted. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "so there is an optimum degree of openness, such as" "" "" "" "great works of art in your apartment!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on how to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need not covered beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when everything is not going smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood in front of the front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts already when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays, only a fraction has ever had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">They drive one in their own car to the hospital, when one dies, and wait while one gets a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without charging the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay happens.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what we want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing come together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But to call it just the "rental industry," the matter does not do justice.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People share a part of themselves openly, and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">It is efficient and reliable, but less authentic for that.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group there would be waiting to fill up a thoroughly and show one at a pub-haircut, of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays homes are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I imagine cities that allow us society and relations instead of loneliness and isolation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were imparted to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs were initiated,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. through our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim yet: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot-like fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, Baby, I wasn't born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to oute me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "" "" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "" "" "why do you oppress yourself?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, against the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only passively accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thinking, questioned, doubted, and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication, deepening with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word "Eileen."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into revolt.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists"... "... in the name of Islam..."... "... Jihad......"... bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the acts of others transformed from one sidewalk into suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA in order to move to a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember -- as we drove in silence -- as deep as it went down into my seat, and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations saying: "be alert," "Be careful," "Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't be slowed down."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "" "" "and again the warnings came:" "" "" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims, dragging and beating.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have got the anger of the people on terrorists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "" "" "nowadays we can actually hear people say:" "" "" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="321">"" "" "" "when will we go?" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">The only question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is erroneous.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US body but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic champions.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking spaces available, but not stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque lead to people of other faiths more tolerant and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area recently told me: people are actually not being radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists can make brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS justifies its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would fit into their imaginations by acknowledging them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "" "" "both groups maintain their ideology on their" "" "" "" "Holy Scripture" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">But when one looks at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which allows them to read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke brought them to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main objective of the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive avenues for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if one puts out test subjects in which negatively reported about Muslims, they are more likely to attack military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood swelled up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When assigning collective guilt it is not just about self-explaining.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the dental department, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, the most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when has I become such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took it out, pulled off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw left me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled men were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment, I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>

<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a classy think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't deceive. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">Looking at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the greatest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">Hi: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion-dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1,500 tiles live in front of the public. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resistable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "there are external commands on the highest level, e.g." "" "" "" "start" "" "" "", "and land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of stern starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that no matter in which position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts, which meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbars, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Even though it is mechanical, very much happens in the interior, so that it can fly stable, and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the Omniopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">You can see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the most extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is directed or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller is out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted standard Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe press there would like to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the reward is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creatures to form it in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">About 1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns transmuted into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">Some 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are formed by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized her as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser-interferometric-gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which improved the recognition performance tremendously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes roamed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their observations like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravitational wave is a clattering in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and moved into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, lecturers teach in the theory of relativity quite eloquent dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched when the waves were hit. an average man's elongation was 10 high - 21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. for this reason, the Ligo staff declared insane.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandth of a radius of an atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">When it comes to sounds, it's different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face, for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just says Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob is breaking them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transform wave pattern into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simply circulate: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">The two bodies turn very fast, you hear the same circus with an additional key change. this is done in this way: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu.</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's sound] Anyone who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-times solar mass, which rotate about as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or fundamentally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super nova.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, occur in the core hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opak.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own rear light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we have no idea at all. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first run, which we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the formation of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Please do not hesitate to contact us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for a year I would say" "" "" "" "Yes!" "" "" "" "before I was afraid." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I start playing the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my fear to keep talking, my social fear --" "" "" "" "puff, gone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, in an unexpected way. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three unbelievable daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, is called all "kitten" for inexplicable reasons.</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very happy.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a striking side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" -telling of playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things look like you are contemplating life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm making television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days, four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programmes, 70 hours of TV, three programmes that are simultaneously in production four times, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of Television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not just produced, so still on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "" "" "I say it because I know what you think if the word" "" "" "" "author" "" "" "" "falls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I say it to you that all of you who work so hard whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just typing on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you had a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the hum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy road, I could go to it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare the sums to them that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the hum -- when I began to work and work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the hum!</seg>
<seg id="618">The totum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The totum is action and activity. the totum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, you can't aspire anything other than greatness.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I only know that I'm not doomed to fail, and I just know that I love the hum." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the totum, the totum, the totum.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Reworked, overloaded, overdriven, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The totem stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single work title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says:" "" "" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totum ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzzing was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't really love my work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My summing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing to delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">There was silence in me.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a demonstration Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the hum and the hum I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly fading the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "hypocise you, stupid author Titan." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do, you do, you do, you do, you love what you do, to be a teacher, a banker, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I'm on the way out, late and she says," "" "" "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when I become aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "" "" "first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "" "" "kitten" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "" "" "she doesn't call anyone any more" "" "" "" "kitten" "" "" "". "</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzz is betting, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says," "" "" "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "" "" "and I say," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and lack of sums, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" lets go.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And this doesn't happen immediately, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The totum comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay at the point.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The totum, the working hum, the titanium um, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of programmes and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totum is no force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum of money depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The hum is the current that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real summing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to experience, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums are simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for what God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the totem again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not answerable to me as much as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what is better for a man than to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rode around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play Ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always resort to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totum of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naïve, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and talking my teenage daughter with me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more does not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes a day, even in a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children make ready.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellfeeling, my world. it is not necessary to be the children. it is important to feel the totals, to have a place for their peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'll make a difference and I die. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "" "" "stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on a piece, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The hum came back in my spare time. the hum then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy comes in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the hum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the hum is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzzing of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but only a part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">FAQ What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A physician who tries to improve the nerve functions by different surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">In the process, one of the most well-known is called "deep-brain stimulation." one electrode is implanted in the brain deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with a skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain swelds and the cranial pressure increases in skull-brain traumas.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your family.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right food, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to make it prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like stem cell culture. large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They constitute 4% of our cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the embryonic stage, they are responsible for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is, however, clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the last step we re-introduced them to the estrangement of the same individual." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autoneuron transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplantar these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-enter the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they completely disappeared as if they had been removed again, they go back home.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a injury to and reimported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we color in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we used the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Look now, when we reimplantedthe cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, it's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is beneficial to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his major imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in fact, democracy is dwindling with us in Europe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence austerity programs that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you to an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe once again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup succumb to a false belief, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are molested, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">I would like to draw you attention to an interesting contradiction that threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "" "" "I call it the" "" "" "" "Twin Summit-Paradox" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few know his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, but they are too afraid to invest where it would be productive and generate income with which one could bear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example, green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3,4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money, until we compare it to the $5.1 billionlion dollar, which was around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing, except to inflate the stock markets and boost real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that do not balance through the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and hence low macroeconomic demand, which like in an infinite loop encourages the pessimism of investors who do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causing the circumstances causing Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my quarrel with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course Athenic democracy closed too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">It would, however, be a mistake to reduce the significance of athenic democracy as a result of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenic democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression, but also more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voice-weighting in questions of the state stocks.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which illuminates very bright, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy only came when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two by gradually undermining politics and alienating them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power, because the power has been diverted from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my quarrel with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that have decimated the animals from which it feeds, so that it starves at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has cannibalised politics so far that it is harming itself by the self-caused economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, inequality rises, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and economy back together, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea, by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very well received.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">"" "" "" "but there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation makes the twin peaks higher, the wastefulness more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we are democratizing the re-united area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which it has brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to "matrix," or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks about the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" utopia instead of the "Matrix" like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business area, please introduce yourself to a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one work place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues derive from capital and from revenues, and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the enterprises, but who do not work therein, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely moving exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency presented by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the Cosmos," into units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a united policy and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "" "" "or will we sink into a" "" "" "" "matrix" "" "" "" "- similar dystopia?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as a liberal Marxist in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunion of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive reduction in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next thing we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not swirled, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: that's a very Greek one, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited democracy to politics, while in the area where most of it plays out -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I may say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can see now in China resembles the very development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To blame China now is to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Greece's Finance Minister at the beginning of the year." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely to say goodbye to the complacency and the constant denial that a massive fault line passed through the Eurozone, and continues to continue, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union.</seg>

<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to keep an economic system that is not viable by political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes happen, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price most have never heard of it, even though he is probably responsible for 22 mid-minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slimmer, has a haircut and refers to Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't pick any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are at the very right of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the turn.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not concerned with getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average bullying, the average television -- the shows that are neither good or bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price wants to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes up a lot of ideas for TV shows and picks up eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon comes out for nothing, do you access right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump or look at again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data what kind of show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process them, and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom about four republican U.S. channels."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something about the average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organising a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together they entered a carriage and decided not to make a sitcom about four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this turn. so exactly where they want to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">When you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work that way, this is a little frightening, because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond the television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. if you come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the US and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, it can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it was possible to predict outbreaks of flu, the bad type, by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "" "" "it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation." "" "" "" "the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" Nature. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly year by year, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these mistakes, data constantly floats into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use a lot of data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some samples about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its individual parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again in order to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, which they wouldn't have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make it a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas than they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "" "" "that's what the data tell us." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data starts to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have made some decisions in my life so far, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, when you have the data available, you want to replace it with a much wiser tool such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the huge amount of data it still pays to make decisions, an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
