Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , which is now dug for the underground tunnel .
farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official map promotes exciting stories .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset already because the car @-@ na@@ vy had a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavarian state government , are anything but current - but precisely why it is very revealing .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a fli@@ ck@@ eting carpet , which you can &apos;t recognize as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called premi@@ er papers , were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and communities .
according to the Bavarian survey administration , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
although the French troops were finally withdrawn with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a surface @-@ covering Bavarian map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph moved forward the project , set up the Top@@ ographical Bureau - and thus the Bavarian State Survey .
the submission form for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is situated in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ an@@ ium &quot; from which the Property Tax is derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small plots yield no more farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other hand of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Sheet , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or the &quot; lying on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ thi &quot; was created .
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was the head of the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended the accus@@ ations of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there had been room for the first time , and later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k @-@ r@@ enti@@ ary in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
youth in the Munich @-@ based Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet on the grounds of the former prison institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational facilities .
to the west lies the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural all@@ usion to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ institution , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ b@@ ings .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; Main Square &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the shopping street called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre .
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn commu@@ ter line takes place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
group of citizens publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Col@@ ors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur throughout the country and be noted here , &quot; said the Group &apos;s statement .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement agencies , who dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , prompted the group to issue the warnings issued by the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they will be beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will stop 75 percent more often than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring Cau@@ tion Money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I hate crime report , which ranked the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the warnings are also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view of further race pro@@ filed .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher pasture fence project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on site .
at the right gra@@ dient of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann granted insights into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and housed in five apartments holiday resorts .
for him , the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
only Regi@@ on@@ ales are on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
as he is also chairman of the B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the electric fence project as &quot; essential . &quot;
I cannot profit from such steep areas .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area is a lot of work , a lot must be worked on with the brush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann emphasized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ iser , even if he did not conduct bio @-@ operation .
for Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they can continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding
a total of 25 plots were fenced in by eleven participants in 2013 .
this means that the open @-@ air area is 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ded up to at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of them were promoted by leaders , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
in this way , the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers pasture fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; explains Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also noted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state funding of pasture f@@ ences .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
the pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of a subsi@@ dis@@ ed by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be enclosed should not be tractor @-@ controlled ( incl@@ ination of more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
the motion of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fischer@@ bacher ordination project 2018 .
the open @-@ plan area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump stops the Statue of Liberty
the sur@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ m Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller gra@@ bbed the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have been laugh@@ ing if he had done so .
but it resor@@ ted to its importance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta reson@@ ated : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem that you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , and your oppressed masses who are longing to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tr@@ umps USA are not welcome .
this conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : indeed , it is a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical ima@@ gery .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of Ex@@ ile .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a disa@@ strous attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives , who bring the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is advancing .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the vast imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horrible voy@@ ages on the decks of ships .
it is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black praise Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
the performance director of the UK athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ler - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year he set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season which included victory with the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; extremely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being the special part of the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special to me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes aiming at po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are at the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t mess around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long before the papers struck him for all , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he compla@@ ined about the criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union therefore su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a repub@@ li@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is ast@@ ounding popular .
he has the second highest agreement of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat@@ sink .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very a@@ dep@@ t at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum designated as official , and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post addressed with some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney general Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not like this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are more likely to be dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or releasing a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the moment of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter recor@@ ders took the lead .

Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days since the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led alongside Arch@@ er@@ field Left to the En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player headquartered in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on the back of his homeland .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
this is the result of scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he approached his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which repeat@@ ed@@ ely hin@@ ders construction work , is a big problem for the contractors of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z explains .
poverty and Death in the Indones@@ ian Gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the quiet Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally known as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ red tu@@ ber is extracted and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , for example to wash dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , it can be dangerous to work late : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which led to independence from the Dutch regime , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transportation .
the city of about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and of corrugated sheets , which were converted by rust into different shades of yellow .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eigner .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst childhood mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s golden land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua people to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $ 20 million , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Bec@@ ome Every@@ thing &quot; is stated in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are especially popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased , since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes as Muslim econom@@ ists come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ts cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who went to work in the province capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native species - Mama @-@ M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of the legal violations in Papua .
the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is initi@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ carot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch off their spot@@ lights .
one of the soldiers stum@@ bled upon their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the qu@@ ita dance - running in the circle and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk .
some demonstr@@ ators started to s@@ nat@@ ch stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ carot@@ ali , looked at the threatening danger and called for peace and called on the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colourful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , lots of shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said reports that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came on the following day &quot; filtered &quot; according to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and sw@@ elled to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he would judge an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for resol@@ ving historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused by the UN for crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident ) .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years but there has been no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus cons@@ ented to the fact that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military was looking for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company ref@@ using to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers involved to account for and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a Te@@ hr@@ an for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al who live in the green lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free East Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army who claimed to defend the rights of Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , in recent years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily det@@ ained , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in R@@ arot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is out of reach .
people here rely on everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a sam@@ pled only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous people of Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua ( although they were given a rare permission for filming ) .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov@@ is campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report of Indonesia &apos;s troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ a : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings ) .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the speaker of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on the spot want more foreign governments to know this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ov@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ov@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber military , are in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like others of Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ov@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai cas@@ u@@ alties carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give them justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fires capture the Tor@@ ch sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire was found on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , that is accidentally named the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai civil defence authorities said that fighting fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 o &apos;clock local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said that the system of panels for insulation and cl@@ adding at the Gren@@ fell Tower in London could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has enjoyed his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup sing@@ les only on two winning sets , thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also so much appreciated five @-@ pack classics , the traditional competition is preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the complete package of reforms for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
even not until the vote was the proposal for many demands to bring the finale to a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right in the first round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less formal media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers take prohibited items on the plane , find out a survey
a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent were deliberately traffi@@ cked by illegal or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft entering the aircraft while accidentally wearing prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late that they were mistakenly with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also confirmed that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those sur@@ vey@@ ed that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent millenni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items intentionally passing by T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent reported having know@@ ingly worn items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it was asking travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled goods would have brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gel@@ y@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most frequently flying .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they can take with them or how much of them .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers are canc@@ eling Order
Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , El@@ on Mus@@ k , CEO of El@@ on Mus@@ k , for the first time revealed another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition just started .
Mus@@ k now cle@@ ars : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
with a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available , including mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , Tes@@ la &apos;s boss does not believe that the cancellation of so far twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his argument : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 - all models should be combined - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 bookings are made per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines , never tested in practice , with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if there are too much delays , the in@@ coher@@ ence of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company can &apos;t prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ drew from the dela@@ ying of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after being su@@ cked by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency showed itself to the needs of state @-@ state environmental authorities more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that expi@@ red on 1 October for states to honour the 2015 standards of o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a prior to his appointment , was a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been persu@@ aded to block or delay regulation , which opposed the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt fores@@ aw that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to determine the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take fri@@ dges seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive collection of o@@ zone rules .
a draft approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had su@@ ed EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man .
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil O@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year thousands of premature deaths contribute .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for a sudden change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump Government to tackle environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Church of the Berg@@ kirche , a seren@@ ade is invited to the old cem@@ etary area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bl@@ gens their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini points out : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel was first mentioned in records in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische urn . count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen including the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , and not the other way round .
so there were people living there .
as evi@@ den@@ ced from the description of the Ober@@ amt of Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the dominant housing estate of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval private Church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , fitted out and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this self @-@ reli@@ ance church .
associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the Bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two sh@@ attered at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be left in 1942 during the Second World War .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 , French troops were located near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower could be stopped .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm broke down the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius @-@ plant from the &quot; Schaff@@ ner Rent@@ meister &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc take part in the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle on Sunday , 16th July , to the sixth seren@@ ade .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo des Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &apos;s place of origin speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
the closing of the seren@@ ade takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers highlight the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius installation , which is of great importance for Tum@@ our and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ bl@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to check approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council of Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim den@@ ies itself &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the boundary of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone existed .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones will prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a mold error .
&quot; due to the lack of planning legislation , the granted approval decision is still un@@ lawful and therefore also rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to examine the matter anew .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four four @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area on the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company in which the town of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that equ@@ ates to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as an investment in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .

a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other persons were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .

city and tra@@ des@@ men plan &quot; home shopping &quot; -@@ weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ burg and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce the people to go shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend meant to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers to which offers travel their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
in preparation for commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
the municipal administration and the business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means the business association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offers , such as the first active day for well @-@ ten@@ ders and sold @-@ out Sunday , talks with all professionals and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes tourists and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the city centre when shopping .
in the end all would have to help anim@@ ate the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
king was said to be able to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly wi@@ ped out .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , informed that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; day , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time , were taking part in the nation &apos;s third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .

tr@@ ump campaig@@ ned after sc@@ anned tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to paying the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked in a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
the US president ino@@ cul@@ ated him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees mig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade presented by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States .
Mr Tr@@ ump retired the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activ@@ ist lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and moved to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped forward with rif@@ les to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a suit of need@@ les - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ screen .
inside , the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cries tore the silence as a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a reproduction .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of the audience sounded very real si@@ ghs .
since 2005 , citizens &apos; rights have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician places a sheet on the body of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot@@ ing for decades , Ci@@ tiz@@ ens say that the dual motivation for Lyn@@ ch campaigns throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .
about at the same time as the choice , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com said a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , during a battle - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore didn &apos;t come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they then moved away from the prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and had fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their depic@@ tion is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of which want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and still more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief @-@ C@@ lan@@ member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room actors Dar@@ by Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the high priest scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , fur@@ ious , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for An@@ cona , the fire is reci@@ proc@@ ating .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs best .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people were &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
and that is exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a dream dress stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holiday &apos;s g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing lob@@ b@@ ying &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the road .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture every eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the ly@@ n@@ ching rope away and wipe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow @-@ players and then collap@@ ses in their arms crying , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats about the im@@ position with a black pair that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that felt the performance of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; Today this is only called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone keeps Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the after@@ math is inspiring in a way , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we can &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner tians to Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf presents a multi @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an optional street corner with wall rests and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ine &quot; logo from East German times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ thal breeders pose as rock po@@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that goes through its &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ESS will se@@ duce you Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , drag a cor@@ pse into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the gorgeous Ha@@ gen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene when Siegfried sm@@ ashes Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
fo@@ sters , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ce and conductor Jan@@ owski are ha@@ iled stor@@ m@@ ly , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands towards the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the show was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 , he had to let go of a g@@ ellen@@ ic pipe concert , and five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the occasional &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ prof@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about this .
&quot; it is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the Ring in a certain way , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but has also grown to an understanding of its view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I draw a positive resume . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in a voluntary year in several places .
where to place ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I have been working at school already in the open day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is your experience with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
Quanti@@ ty : I graduated from SL@@ C .
and then a civil engineering studies , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to make something different to work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it so ?
lot : I collected great impressions .
in the winter semester , I will start my studies in the social sector .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from an old home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
in a different way than in civil engineering ?
amount : well , here it is not a question of calcul@@ ating extras .
there are always other people who have a different story behind each other .
whether a fu@@ gi@@ tive , a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is the same .
Pear@@ son cuts out another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as a further restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the reduction in jobs , which the General Director John Fall@@ on , predominantly announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , is in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 positions have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost cutting programme to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business driven by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed during suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded , declared a NATO Declaration .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the subur@@ b of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done as a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated at the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ org is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civil cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ bers killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump weighs down the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public trust in government , politics and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , after which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to promote the so @-@ called &quot; O@@ zone Reg@@ ulations 2015 , &quot; and said that it is showing the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and in response to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump is intended to boost economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
the EPA website says that breathing air , which contains o@@ zone , &quot; reduces lung function and can increase respiratory symptoms , &quot; such as asthma .
community wants common room
at the end of the decision , the decision was made clear : with two votes , the district council of F@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els resol@@ ves the establishment of a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing piece of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will take a while for the area to be owned by the church community so far , there is now no planning obstacle for the project stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space for this purpose .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council is so@@ aring such a common area not as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the citizens &quot; just living area , but openly in the congregation .
as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Cafe &quot; made the round .
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the running budget last autumn , is sweet@@ ened by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible .
the proposed resolution is to signal the investor that in this regard it is not possible to throw a bil@@ l@@ board between the legs , stating that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - as well as a pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the tr@@ ump height and makes the construction more economical - possible .
need@@ less to say , this is not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it helps : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unanim@@ ously , he passes the board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which one is not so well ahead , but now you are sitting in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I have difficulty with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is strictly speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any of the wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy but receive a genuine counterpart , which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ i &apos;s proposal to split the proposal according to the proposed resolution finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we sum@@ mar@@ ise the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel managers at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Itali@@ ans on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six trials , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti , who expected a &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
wander from the star to the star
in the resin , the first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created in Germany .
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; met the need for the information needs of many visitors .
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
in a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans &quot; well at@@ tain@@ able installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
question would be St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the tablets should be added to the internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star appeared more lumin@@ ous than another , even though it was essentially far@@ ther away .
also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Göttingen Förder@@ verein Planet , there is something similar to the planned Star@@ bu@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Path .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary route leads with its stel@@ ae to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ planet &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun exactly measures 75 meters away and measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path amounts to just over four kilometers .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to needs about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the March to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to fight for a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , going down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super Spring@@ board Champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put forth his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
when the pair was pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mate noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather@@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for Bron@@ s &#91; to 140 &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 pound &#93; and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what the fans ask .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later openly expressed himself in the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he would like Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday struggle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show the impact , then boxing .
both said that they could sense the momentum created for their struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sts
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost the control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market at 16.@@ 30 .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed in the direction of the north for about an hour , afterwards traffic on the left lane could be passed along the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three chain work better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener at Braunschweig , Germany , that the optimisation of the defense formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first race of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also , would not have been the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to better watch out in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ chain is also to be further optimized .
and a gate after a free fall , the For@@ tun@@ en also don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one stands next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the tri@@ chain after the experience gained in the preparation of the tri@@ chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just finished in the three chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not have as many game errors as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a draw from a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good start to the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about this .
&quot; the start into the season I only judged after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Radi@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely due to an accident .
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against one of the best @-@ selling ones in the bones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the lawyer of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland will be an easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep it away only because we are entitled to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Radi@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ seekers application tests released
the recent test results of asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Ministry of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ bon@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the assessment of age during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration Service ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , migration c@@ et 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det submitted the 5@@ 81 published results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of the medical age assessment , when x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work encompasses the evaluation of human biological maturity to see whether they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency advoc@@ ated the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the state road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are proceeding well .
on Wednesday , a total of seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of Public Transport and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as an operating way .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge deck is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to go .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of pipes through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach required a particular feeling of intuition .
because there is a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
prior to the work , the local residents were informed about the project by hand@@ books .
in addition , fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be f@@ ished .
the traffic is regulated by a traffic light for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance the road is fully blocked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three bridge renov@@ ations amounts to 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the Krei@@ fel Vol@@ cano ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad federation , which shows a peaceful flag on this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites to the poster &quot; great campaign kick @-@ out . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the event will not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel remain colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and there@@ with directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really looking forward to : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; age @-@ old potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ ic Ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ em there weren &apos;t enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a view to the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square , he says : &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
it also does that : at 20 o &apos;clock a band for entertainment takes care of the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Boy .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch talk about their speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ Event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 clock .
the police can cr@@ ush - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series of Has@@ lo@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ trumpet &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have conducted sol@@ op@@ positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli .
both unite the desire to not only exceed the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
so Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play mix with a fascinating overall art work .
this programme was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ linger Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is very open about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; .
the well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt very bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with every serious one I had .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; she especially suffered from it in the school@@ days when she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some consider myself ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole of the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the Party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
according to For@@ bes , Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , compelling message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ uses for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it wasn &apos;t the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who were gra@@ bbed gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite its comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised within itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made but Congress supports the Task Force &apos;s recommendations that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London following a presentation at IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a funeral act for soldiers cut off in Mali
in a funeral service in Frit@@ z@@ lar , North Hessen , around 1000 people of the two soldiers in Mali have thought of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Defense Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the still un@@ explained down@@ fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two in@@ verse pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff from Northern H@@ esse had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the German Ar@@ med Forces in the St. Peter &apos;s Cathedral .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took par@@ ting .
after that , the funeral took place in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
grapes laid down roses , the relatives stood in arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , Frit@@ z@@ ere and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ anic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flying operation of the tiger helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
also Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Le@@ yen Minist@@ erial : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and said it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , it is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
he retired in 2016 and also puts the title &quot; Prince Su@@ pper . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not consider himself equal to his wife - even after his death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish King &apos;s House , declared that he was not as equal to his wife .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for in the last 50 years .
born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , Mar@@ gre@@ the met in London in 1965 .
at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , the sympathy and sympathy of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing at the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year rule .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik had spoken about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was swa@@ ying , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in Germany had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprise of a Green Party parliam@@ ent@@ arians from their Land@@ tag faction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the country &apos;s election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the current Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U faction leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to include them .
so CD@@ U and F@@ DP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Gre@@ ens 68 .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to be scheduled for January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether or not to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it essential that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag depri@@ ves the Prime Minister of confidence and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options have to be legally audi@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in silence we will discuss all the questions if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something kur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself emphasized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the ren@@ eg@@ ade parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their agricultural agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that she has returned her Land@@ tag mandate , which she has received via the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ hats extraordinary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to put any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the diso@@ be@@ ying of Lower Saxony @-@ backed Green Members of El@@ ke T@@ westen combined with CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conduct of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to let the Parliament vote quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exit of T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her lost vanity and her fru@@ stration for the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U group leader , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen combined into the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Country election with personal career gifts .
at that time the CD@@ U was strongest with the SPD , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a razor @-@ thin majority in parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ch , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp printing .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ essi@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected egg bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if , according to all we know presently , a health risk is practically excluded .
is Al@@ di taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the German Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
just like the manufacturers , trade has to take care that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual sugar content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ polluted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , production companies do not have immediate guilt .
on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damages due to alleged illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little control in the case of serious accidents .
is it just lacking at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive back@@ war@@ dness ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can exist are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a clear statement that I expect a complete clari@@ fication from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to a right .
as a result , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are confronted with a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the position of food@@ borne animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect all relevant authorities that the facts will be enlightened quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the football rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded editions of the European football clubs will not dis@@ rupt N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to get the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar receives a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
with security , PS@@ G can make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to acquire players , but must counter@@ act with legitimate means of revenue which allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs which had enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er business .
during the current three @-@ year renewal period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the presi@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to dis@@ courage excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to ampli@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , against The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for the bill for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the redemption rate for the next five years can be stated in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( back then $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Q@@ at@@ ari company may sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come on payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambassador will become ambassador and could easily figure out such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G would mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the agreement .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players go and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financially dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said President of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last shar@@ ehol@@ ding to PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the overall landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has a club , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair because you can go different paths or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new source supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced Fre@@ y Board Cho@@ colate for Swiss .
now the long @-@ term cooperation is at a possible end : the airline canc@@ els the order .
on request of the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
each year , some 17 million small , red @-@ white , red @-@ white chocolate tablets distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants to the passengers before landing .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but even more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers can answer this question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract in the spring of 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo took place two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers are p@@ am@@ pered with treats from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in the Business Class &apos;s passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter called the Sk@@ et@@ ch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by getting into the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids who are grown up - nevertheless they created the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; ten years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more on the principle of watering , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the am@@ i@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy malicious plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see Mr. Ru@@ dd &apos;s eternal young , Matt D@@ ill@@ ons under@@ li@@ pp@@ age from &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy .
these are the moments of accidental del@@ usion that could pre@@ heat this fran@@ chise as a way of repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives a missing TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de out the voice . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was reduced to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are repeatedly visiting the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a schol@@ ar .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs .
sla@@ p on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police succeeded in hitting the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office announced on Friday .
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , the officers ensured large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
in Italy , two persons were arrested in the case of ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as early as summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office determined Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the big deployment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was to identify Italian citizens with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the gang of the gang .
a large gaps in the foreigners &apos; register complain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has reported to a media report on large gaps in the immigration central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the recorded data could result in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , 10 million people with foreign citizenship are registered in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
this means that the data is managed by around 600 national authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and are no longer supposed to appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , there are EU citizens who do not have to travel at all in statistics on tax@@ able people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false regulations led to a distorted debate on how to deal with those who have been paid off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in paper , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper has been referring to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state may return it to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Office is writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with low @-@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the inclusion and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to it as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman for the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened because of the short@@ com@@ ings of the Italian asylum system , un@@ constitutional admission conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ ri@@ chen@@ bach had already provided the blood donation service to other people .
at least by the twelve citizens that were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation di@@ gni@@ fies the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to foreigners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Chief of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , as the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents .
three persons could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions carried out in spring in Ober@@ ri@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district administrator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were one of the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ mm , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter delivered ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation over a rise .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but she sign@@ alled that in the coming years interest increases would be necessary to rein the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the cost of bor@@ rowing might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term since the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; extent than the markets expected .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ mental &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ mentally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the down@@ wards corrected growth forecasts by the Bank for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % projected in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound reb@@ elled against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations for net interest rate and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and petty rise in sal@@ aries , as the tightening is going to get worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is partly offset by lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the sound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for a rise in interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will be put on again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of the swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive once again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals are exp@@ iring and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closed , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people who are controversial
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by healthcare to a first three @-@ year study for valued 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling of the Supreme Court last year , confir@@ ming that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in Inf@@ ectious Diseases .
pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if directed specifically towards needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English epide@@ mic .
from September on people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individual controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank manager with a passion for real estate , contracted in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make full use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms to be stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold pieces , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance there are mirr@@ ored units for all seating and j@@ ars from Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went in there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ weight so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the soil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to increase the floor space while simultaneously using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and that can help create an emotional bond within a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square met@@ er@@ ge@@ of some standard in something quite Ama@@ zing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confrontation with one of the largest real estate agents in Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place at the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family in 1973 bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the Stad@@ ts@@ en@@ rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family , has written about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a judi@@ ci@@ ary notes that this means Col@@ in &apos;s property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the assessments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled out .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both sides .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who were engaged in dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ y of the family .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark has paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very well , although he was a former member of the AF@@ L and after a biography from the year 2015 von Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case was in front of the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw up our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Chief of Staff Tr@@ ump plans to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even track .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior officials on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that came into the hands of the president .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television is decades back - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg against Politi@@ co in February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ ump Twitter habit@@ ual under control , according to six former electoral civil servants , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption ent@@ ails a steady praise . &quot;
okay . that &apos;s okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something , which we do not know others - that tr@@ umps twe@@ ets would have even more combus@@ tible material without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff managed to keep him out of trouble for a few times , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump controversy .
a part of the problem is that the people in a White House composed of competing parties will always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
in May , PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - fully engaged in this story - reported on the preference of advis@@ ers to provide doub@@ t@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that it is stiff@@ ening from where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article written by Got@@ tar@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; be the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke them .
tr@@ ump reading the article and began questioning employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most searched criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the aid of the population is asked and hoped .
this summer , the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and requested .
on Friday Euro@@ pol reported from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar in winter .
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting to vacation destinations had to be hidden , was said by Euro@@ pol .
I have compiled 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been on site and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online booking could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Number &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travellers on the base of war , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the church to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their invasion .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
the Council has to be forced through shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be lo@@ oted by another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers rose this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as quickly as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently undergoing renovation and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the then Ambi@@ ance company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13th , 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income by the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the district council office as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Fre@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospective customers in the house .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has bought the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Man@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building a construction container in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what major renovation works are going to be done .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful citizenship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and conference room are part of the facilities .
one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ rise city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its 60 rooms wants to set itself wide , sha@@ ver further explains .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men feel comfortable in the hotel .
conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already conducted so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s performances are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
when asked about the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly what he wants .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the exterior installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
in the courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller shall have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people entrusted to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there were already the first proposals of the Gre@@ y@@ um in connection with a meeting between the Tr@@ umps of the Ol@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Krem@@ lin of interven@@ ing specifically in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men were to stand , who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also magni@@ fies more and more tr@@ umps in private and business environments .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special promot@@ er Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to prove the present evidence in potential cases of crime and to decide whether to be charged .
therefore , Grand j@@ uries are also called Prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be contacted by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to charge persons for hearing under oath .
according to CN@@ N , demonstrations have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting were called upon to make a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also attended the interview .
on Thursday evening , legal experts told us that it would show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charge of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the implementation of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump .
amid the new revelations , the president took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but it also usually works secretly , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the investig@@ ator on &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that he was not determined against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it stated in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this r@@ usti@@ fication , alle@@ gations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de justice .
Com@@ ey spoke in front of a Senate committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting up of the investigations against Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n , the national security advis@@ er at that time .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
following the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special agent and its employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to be released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two groups of repub@@ li@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented law designs on Thursday in which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
in the West Antar@@ cti@@ ca , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has become detached from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ture &apos;s almost seven @-@ fold size .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs on a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted .
with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for man does not come from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for some 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ture so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a few years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is broken down there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never moved as far as it is now .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ eber@@ gs does not increase the level of sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can flow more quickly than before .
this could increase the sea level , but only to a lesser extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
it drops off regularly there .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most important withdrawal since the beginning of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will now grow again or reti@@ re in the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers did not take back the break @-@ off of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , however , in the past few decades many ice hoo@@ ves of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long tip of the Antar@@ ctic extends towards South America .
according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ arif to staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U ur@@ ges to withdraw from the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before the summer break , there were 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are apparently very sought after .
there were around 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be awarded this year .
still personnel are missing to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and human resource development , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the forward @-@ looking application shortage .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , point out concrete measures for newcom@@ ers and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is a high number of employees who are leaving the service due to illness or age .
high time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , leader of the CD@@ U faction , goes beyond the joint proposal with his party .
he took care of a la@@ zy surprise already in the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Day when he questioned the personnel costs cap publicly and stun@@ ned the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be verified that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration should seek a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate with the unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ related cities , &quot; states .
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the Public Service .
the sal@@ aries are at present exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exist when you change to a higher level oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees were concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ rik und Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy intensi@@ fies tone on NGO Mig@@ rants &quot; Bo@@ ots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the extensive alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o .
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess any accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Jugend for@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that his crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are supplied to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s record , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of expos@@ ing themselves to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs , involved in search and rescue missions , have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions .
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is .
Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the ba@@ il@@ out measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope of reaching Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine women &apos;s bi@@ kers , the Berlin out@@ post , and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome addition .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again , the look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days there were again many al@@ timet@@ ers .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and tur@@ rets brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and nearly 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - both sporty and cultural .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of being swe@@ ating through the stadium ra@@ ging in wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognized the first Federal Police Offic@@ ers who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says managing director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there will be quite a few clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the former coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile consul@@ ted an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal particularly with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract one could be much more often present on these markets online than to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ schaft to Asia only once a year .
what is it about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup simulation are being fought on a competitive level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long been established , in which professionals compete against each other .
and e @-@ Sport has already been part of the official program for the Asian Games 2022 .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has long dealt with the question .
for Professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , e @-@ sports is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses , which can also be found in classical sports - for example elevated heart frequency , stress reactions , hormonal changes .
in addition , they need cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid re@@ activity .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also to their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perfect player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and the structures of classical sports were missing in the scene .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative impact of e @-@ sport .
the players are on the move internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no inter @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tour@@ neys .
in three years , sales are expected to reach a total of 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , e @-@ sports are no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write .
many countries are already on the move to the international level .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eball star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ ingen Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sports have been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and France , the German soccer league football clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany lag behind Germany in a European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
falling into nostal@@ gia and glori@@ fying the old times is no longer sufficient today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also de@@ bris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that only football stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide due to texts Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
she had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward @-@ looking eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they regret completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he had not found out that their age or maturity or mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t have the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I surround him with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will be carrying for eternity . &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; persecuted &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or she would be a a@@ unt to his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this single person with whom I have been together every day since I was born , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hook up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; everything you have to do is switch on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was looking at Roy &apos;s death and ordered her to benefit from the case by any press .
the case has dealt with legal opinion .
among the few defending Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber : learning from the new mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain in the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
Bayern Munich tr@@ umps the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt .
anything was different on his seat in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ ber immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he just made the rush to his arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain .
well , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could also interpret the coach &apos;s sign .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f existing from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holidays , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those who wish to keep a lot of things , which one wants to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to take part in the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ pped over the field as a mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m .
to the right rear , that is its position , the white binding on the arm did its rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to steer the un@@ invited tro@@ op .
he had the view of the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal therefore to over@@ play his missing fitness ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on devil come out to tie in to the achievements of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ ly also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le make their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t not negative .
after all , it worked out very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted sovereign .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition Sü@@ ver tried to successfully compete for a few times in the match @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the outcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was picked up for this style too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bayern @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw following the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the newcom@@ er any more .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ FB ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ FB @-@ ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller has announced on Twitter shortly before the game and wants the Ö@@ FB @-@ La@@ dies all the best .
the Bavarian legi@@ onna@@ ire is basically club @-@ mate of Ö@@ FB @-@ Captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and is thrilled with our La@@ dies .
the tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sp@@ lash .

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business lo@@ oses Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minister .
Frank Schi@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; bis@@ sing gras@@ ps the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
the Ministry is still hoping for a planning process this year , until 2021 the construction law shall stand .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ammer Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ director Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees this as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier aims , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company lo@@ oms the Chamber of Industry .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier looks at the new champion bonus for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed championship examination and € 2500 , if graduates within ten years after master education become self @-@ employed .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce , is out of place in the planned road construction .
up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ sing in regional mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be assigned to external offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U faction refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Schi@@ ava also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a rating of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months due to dis@@ agreements .
Audi to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a reaction reaction
one day prior to Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW chair@@ woman said the company believes that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars will be modified in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions .
neither of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alization of exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of imp@@ eding the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were charged in the United States , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States has been expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , the Saturday morning a raft goes through Munich , which has a special message .
if you go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large Inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
it shows a garbage dump .
the start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is intended to shar@@ pen the wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft flew over the Is@@ ar and again this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los bu@@ d n@@ oses and laugh against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was , at times , one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ists , the no@@ d@@ ules of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the early years as an artist he suggested , among other things , as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came through at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish mur@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he re@@ port@@ edly sits still at the drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ ch according to his own information , works daily for nearly ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks continue to find its cute characters worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which will come back to the movie screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
therefore he rather relies on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence under threat of climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of drought @-@ remin@@ ding conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , which prepares scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more .
this has an impact on the lifetime of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro@@ bacterial which transfers the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and much is at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in Thur@@ in@@ gia is celebrating its 1200 anniversary this year .
the highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
the Krä@@ mer , the guil@@ ds , the merchants , the vag@@ ants or a land @-@ cold camp should be in the city centre on these days .
assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat to Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organized crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no resp@@ ite of violence , and while throughout the country the bodies pile up , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states .
her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as , is among the latter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hung on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ x building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Federal At@@ tor@@ ney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders who are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ x , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the Ri@@ odo@@ x newspaper in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ours tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug que@@ ens that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; calm &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the children , presum@@ ed vein @-@ members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper publishing the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ v and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters dar@@ ed to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ x , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ I Award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ x team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for routine to ruin his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , said the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ v Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and milit@@ ants in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the Ri@@ odo@@ x offices in a four @-@ storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were not trust@@ worthy of the Gover@@ nor himself .
it is months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this week &apos;s edition , Ri@@ odo@@ x has concentrated on three main stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known Bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures , which concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that ab@@ duc@@ ted a kidn@@ apping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost the entire century on all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ profile cases of corruption .
Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about preceding incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
just a few months earlier , readers of Val@@ dez &apos;s column were regarded as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees became something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few characters and went to the office of the prosec@@ utor for another journalist next morning .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs .
journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country by sub@@ trac@@ ting &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; in organised protests on pav@@ ements and buildings .
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth .
she has since urged her to be re@@ organized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; media group assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some stores have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her Director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists escaped from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City for three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who remain behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that the drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tened him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began tot@@ aling .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan have left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b@@ stone edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ x via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez looked at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ č@@ e followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same day that Ja@@ vier was murdered , who asked me to send them to the street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to escape enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , although a start@@ ling one .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ er were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r that was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens of the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well preserv@@ ative state has been amazed by researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy soil cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you b@@ link only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better blend in his surroundings and avoid his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its base .
although counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by sufficient pressure through car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution encouraged the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than spo@@ ils , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period have been , &quot; Brown said .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on po@@ inters on his life , including his con@@ served Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes , to find out what he ate as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable , since it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ an era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is asleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the observ@@ able ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes , which were resting from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swept by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ sts still cover even b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in Lot@@ to .
the more I get it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ our plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is at his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thunder@@ storms : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
a violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , at 17.@@ 00 hrs , between the outlets Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another .
at first there were no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a light to moderate serious injury , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large number of rescue vehicles were charged at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilometer long way back was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , it also came on the counter @-@ road to massive disability - thanks to numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade made a note of the characteristics of the vehicles , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between an automobile transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you &apos;re sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and use it to de@@ value the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available for many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convenience check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway card de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use these , however , some requirements need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
you also have to buy the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and took the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , simply check in the DB navig@@ ator yourself .
this allows passengers to make their journey more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB long @-@ distance marketing director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that alongside delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because of@@ ten@@ times you have , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents required for the validation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document that must be refer@@ enced .
the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the part or large room and delays in the control of his own tickets and the conductor takes the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart Essen .
further concessions on the same track have not been un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shocked to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continually saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return to tweet about people on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who carried a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have been accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the point of view of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter , carrying a cau@@ lif@@ lower and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , they discussed a conversation that they had &quot; countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different than the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Chief Offic@@ ers of Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped them to pass on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly , a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was the student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black congregations .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film during an evening demonstration .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be presented , for I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show unexpected personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the incar@@ nation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferrari &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , played the film &quot; Black@@ Lives@@ up@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must wear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really kept by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it insi@@ sts , however , that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not by chance , even though it was at the forefront because in a life at these jun@@ ctions as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on disappeared long ago , but the racial links between the commun@@ e and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from dream to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents since its first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the supporters build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , including the other businesses , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
this will stop at the beginning of the construction work .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in addition to Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been selling in the Mark@@ thalle almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing enters a market hall in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping list in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there &apos;s enough of this in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
because after all the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top .
as you can see , stores in a shopping mall are rented out by larger companies , as the r@@ ents there are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a pity , special shops don &apos;t exist anymore and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market hall go through during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit @-@ Galerie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already make it possible to drive all business from Bit@@ burg before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ as@@ ants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ cker and Haar@@ lem , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence service provider kis@@ sed a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after opening secret diplomatic news about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .
with the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal Bri@@ ph@@ ews , which , over the course of two years , exchanged several letters .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ose Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would deliver judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama , in fact , only a few days after the book was published , would demand Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy encounter .
there is also something profound and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump manages a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces , in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able paths in order to further fl@@ are the rigid circuits he should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing challenged with her overwhelming signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic spl@@ inter@@ ing , &quot; the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic book .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of the disciplinary powers of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she was to do it , then she will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ak@@ ras that cl@@ ash like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University , sought for murder
a country@@ wide chase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued warran@@ ts for murder on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as demonstrated by the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and Det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that she was now in absence and had been excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and background of the victim and research a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the timetable of WA@@ DA to comply with the code that describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conduct the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has admitted a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we won &apos;t admit to what does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov admitted to problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA CEO Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli commented that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs anymore
these were divided by the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could be further excluded from any health impairment , it was said in the communication .
from now on only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ine anti @-@ lice .
this enables Al@@ di to establish clarity and transparency among his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your business not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees in your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; there was simply no consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she has called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up race is growing up to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , provide specialist groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and address themselves directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where &apos;s the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap @-@ in surveys and surveys of certain teams , it provides a company &apos;s heat card that shows which units have most of the ail@@ ments and which managers have low approval results so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber wrapped in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of anno@@ y@@ ance where those who have spoken have been punished .
this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T .
global governance , regulation and compliance could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
conver@@ gence has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent allows companies to send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has employed Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dating and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practi@@ c@@ alities .
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conver@@ gence received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing set of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only interventions .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that has heard their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach returns if their portfolio companies are running well . companies are working well when employees are engaged and engaged .
when the third @-@ party analytics tools promise third @-@ party commitment and commitment , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can dem@@ oti@@ fy disappointment and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ise employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4000 discussions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , staff ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care why I should ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly staff surveys , has been able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company has always received new insights about the employees , and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practice and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football players chat on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas on campus .
some have stri@@ pped off their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour exercise , before returning to the water man football center at 6 : 30 am the next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is for the boys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was closed on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the fry moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times conducted in West@@ wood practical exercises .
in the course of August 18 , they are supposed to hold 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they spread far@@ ther , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in light of the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining bene@@ vis Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been covered with foot@@ balls that will clean a protected network behind a gate post , will be no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then stop recording an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false information to third party fak@@ ers and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect possible mis@@ messages and to send them to fac@@ tual reviews that may display results of the fact checking out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the May presidential elections , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate explanation in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts @-@ review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fac@@ tual reviews of third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related article , &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; spann@@ ed the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another bri@@ tish artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found suddenly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s his thumb print !
and letters always smell of smoke ; for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself were there .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) this seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ brid@@ le heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was granted full access only in 2006 , when Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps representing what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let all go his course ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , whom the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid during the English Reformation for seven years .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler depicted Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed quite Ga@@ un@@ er , always paying debts and spending money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking boys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ marks . &quot;
after the end of his commitment to the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must finish with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf conc@@ eal
with the closure of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team intend to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will pay a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) deliber@@ ates on pensions and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week too .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
the meeting was attended by the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .
that was the number of civilians in the Y@@ AS in the over@@ population .
the government forces the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were de@@ posed .
since the coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wi@@ per of the attempted coup .
against 4@@ 86 persons , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , has been negotiated in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; fully clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ e@@ as@@ iness to the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban on female soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the help of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ste@@ ered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times , they appe@@ aled their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan urged the military to step backward step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is pur@@ pos@@ efully pushing forward the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot;
if that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it intends to lower legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens from other countries are issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
ministry wants to clean track for the shuttle bus
over the past few months , over the past few months , over the future of the race ticket has been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to be quite fast .
before the end of the year , the track on which the tourist railway is going to be built will be built .
in order to secure the future of the railway ticket in the long term , construction works will start on the track this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to continue ordering and refurb@@ ishing the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country comm@@ its itself to this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; explained traffic jam secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ took 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being voted for final approval , said S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race track shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the race track shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , in the course of a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people in order to re @-@ order them regularly in the future .
the route is also very steep in parts .
the ascension of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought that it can &apos;t become more cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are funny about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex@@ d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the robot &apos;s eye colour to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails .
but it becomes more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ wise woman look progressive .
modern sex@@ d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , trouble one most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
its origin and increasing sophisti@@ cation refer to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course do not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their growing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what is tran@@ spir@@ ing from the fr@@ ing@@ es can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed body and the po@@ ke eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , im@@ itating the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their personalities , the robots are not real women .
they cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing suggest@@ ing independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to put it in the 2017 phr@@ ase@@ ology : maid
Tr@@ umps Major Performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a max@@ im of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US voters have also split families in small format .
there were newspapers around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all re@@ port@@ edly demanding to burst our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ ump to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lin@@ ks@@ y poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the repub@@ li@@ can relationship with which she fought for decades , suddenly and completely independently on the same side .
to the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but I notice in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the end of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we talk about &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer run away .
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; suddenly appearing in comparison to his standards suddenly as the concept of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
today I find myself surrounded by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump walks , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York car park , and the best three bu@@ cks that can be spent in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ pping music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
but the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el still is a strange magic experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ olds , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can walk on it in the 40 &apos;s and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given it the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need arises .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing gr@@ inning , while I was tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us , for the second time , left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts . according to the prison authorities he suffered a fall in his cell .
due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first mur@@ derer .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he had his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell &apos;s six @-@ year prison sentence , which they say is too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Service said they will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ door aqu@@ ers from F@@ itt@@ ens and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were fired into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Mrs. An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle , who grows up in the h@@ ens , but is released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lively band called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle at the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and bred it from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wollen .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les that bore the cylinders to make the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said school leader An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wanted every four @-@ person to feel accepted in his new school .
thanks to Dr. Michael Müller , former school manager Michael Müller , who is always in contact with school@@ children , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cooking time is over now , explained teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she dis@@ likes her students after two years of instruction only very reluct@@ antly , because it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they have been able to rely on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viert@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to conclude , all students let a song of summer time and holiday time sound .
great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal tents was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose significant fin@@ es .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court may impose a fine of money .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are expected to improve the emissions behaviour of cars from emissions classes Euro 5 and Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or less are excluded from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates before are only valid for the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fit was ordered by the German Federal Railway Authority ( Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but not yet called a precise date .
Daimler informed every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions ent@@ ail ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anine .
this depends on the commitment of the producers as well as from the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the issue of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE betra@@ ys to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would consult , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat to a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans are threatening .
in rural areas , there has so far been no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE betra@@ ys to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) also belong to the hon@@ ors .
awards will be awarded at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the awar@@ ding ceremony .
the prize winner Le@@ ar , which has become known with progressive TV series , has already announced his intention to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that weighs me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former lau@@ re@@ ates include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Mayor , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written out - however , suitable candidates are rare .
for the past 31 years , W@@ acker has been Mayor of Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he tells of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time it is surprising that no application has required the requirement profile so far .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach functions as the lower building rights authority for the Administr@@ ative Committee , the applicant must present relevant agreements .
this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill it out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but proximity to the citizens is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , a number of important projects have accumulated and the W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the town worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a areas and the parking lot approximately are encountered .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even stadium restoration is still a topic .
the latter will book about 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
working here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is plenty of room for a city building master .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted very flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what is pur@@ pos@@ eful &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master stresses .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears a high degree of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with us for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor to remain for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and wanted to stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
if you would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach , you should have completed a degree in degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor of Arts in the field of architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction planning and planning law .
the town planning office is subject to civil and civil engineering , structural planning , estate planning , administration of urban properties , urban depot with building yard and urban gardening , as well as lower building rights authority , including historical preservation .
throwing bike on lines : road track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike on the lines in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
a ros@@ ary roller and a bike driver were observed near the scene of the crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a sl@@ ump in Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have brought themselves into great danger and also end@@ anger the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delay of the delay and the costs for rail transport , p@@ als of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum goes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern railway line could be guided without disabilities .
nearly ten people were accommod@@ ated Friday morning , two of them considered the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they had delays .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead power lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study is just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and UK 300@@ ,000 causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not inv@@ ade the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their ent@@ rails .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an intoler@@ ant diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus when the same system works in people .
the Post@@ do@@ k@@ tor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same family , which had been separately accommod@@ ated , had not had this .
it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial flavors of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA @-@ sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice .
mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , the researchers caused L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice lining , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , thinks Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid @-@ field player on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked off against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ gio and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which admitted M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ line for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a fantastic job to fulfil three of its four primary commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painting &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington , the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner across the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was drawn into the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new kick @-@ off for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , Social @-@ Democratic ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
but no stor@@ rage from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - so the most important wish of the election fighters was l@@ ur@@ king .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with increasing horror .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with head@@ wind in the approach .
there were failures .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once more shows : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Green Party member has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the country &apos;s election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the ren@@ eg@@ ade Lower Saxony Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transfer to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ ire must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal managing director and election campaign manager of the Green Party editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; it must not be true , &quot; an SPD election champion si@@ ghs when the new ob@@ scene message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning .
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , stands for the transfer of the green Members of El@@ ke T@@ westen there to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and minor crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the un@@ expectedly sharp defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades were re@@ ass@@ uring at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this became - and indeed everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into w@@ rap@@ pers , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ gh sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
the comrades in the weeks had lab@@ ori@@ ously scra@@ m@@ bled back .
then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was held by Hamburg .
and with him came the next blow .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in the crisis communication he made everything wrong , which one can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony already stood in the criticism for a long time .
my@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or maybe just for this reason , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to grant him a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal pressures of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens basically no fault .
and Schulz was not at all .
for the time being , Com@@ rades , therefore , endeav@@ our to keep our own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arians , t@@ v@@ ests .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic as Ms. T@@ westen presents her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Head of the Party Left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen there has been elected parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxony de@@ pu@@ ties continue .
the logical consequence is that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for the background to be clari@@ fied .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for City Centre III
those who want to san@@ e their coming home in the years can soon get support from the country .
on top of this , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg City Development were in touch on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened .
since 1991 , there have been several renovation areas .
at the time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is also important to promote the interior development , not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 came from the country , the rest from the community of sens@@ ations .
how is a refurb@@ ishment area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to examine Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned territory at all .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries could also be postpon@@ ed again .
the foot@@ bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , i.e. per property .
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a statute .
the grant period for the funding has been running until 30 April 20@@ 26 since January 1 , 2017 .
until September this year , however , the survey would be carried out only once , in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the resolution must be made as soon as possible , so that the restoration can begin in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commun@@ e must carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is a matter of assessing the ab@@ norm@@ alities of the city and to decide when it is being renovated and to what extent .
there is also a re@@ organisation note in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , there will be questionna@@ ires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which deals among other things about the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and apartment arch , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a residential area can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the allocation of subsidies according to the gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle is working - who comes first , first grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funding for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Location II &quot; were shown to make the present &quot; tasty . &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to come in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am would like to change the locks at houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and on his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South of La@@ wn for an event highlighted by American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military supplied by TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , which was built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was exhibited in addition to a yacht made of Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire engine and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forkli@@ ft .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event its superior , the deputy commander of the aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long it remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in the evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second crew needed for the return flight .
the original crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second crew was required in the end .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could harm the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command@@ ant wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was called the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave a push for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for political reasons .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in operation against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 occup@@ ations often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to dep@@ ose US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
as a tr@@ ump at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted among the training needs of the crew for the month , said an official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters units also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took over the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget awards for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House ar@@ gues that the real cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , Do@@ D re@@ funds do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of contracts .
at that time , the former Press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Take Ne@@ uss in front of a tri@@ cky task
leading edge of the Second Tennis league will be held at the third ranking of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of five games still flaw@@ less , the top pioneer of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality .
in any case , Team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V in Düsseldorf , imports from the high north are mainly concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Go@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ all ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good serving of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the north is convenient .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
after the Chall@@ enger tournament in the itali@@ an Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man won &apos;t be part of the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec , will be his first action this season .
yesterday , the previously un@@ defeated chil@@ i Hans Pod@@ stran@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo , with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , was held at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .

if it is sufficient for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coach station around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay met the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Congress a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and Brussels even fo@@ amed the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the plan is to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from O@@ MV , together with other European companies , are worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one is massive .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise sanctions even by an Executive Order .
there are twelve weapons to choose from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen itself that the Group could defend and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos relay 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is far from over .
the ech@@ el@@ ons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on 1 September Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly ch@@ illed ch@@ illed .
the city operates 46 children &apos;s day centers in Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kit@@ ten year there were 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are looked after 45 days of the week , in the &quot; K@@ ita &quot; lunch , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from the 1st of September : they warm up the supplied dishes , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give the food out , clean out , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are permanently assigned to a ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two groups as well as seven @-@ section equipment - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita @-@ Team &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be performed by a special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has shown to be the most economical in comparison to the cost comparison for the city as the most economical way , it means from the press office .
and this , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; but these hours don &apos;t weigh so much with around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz says .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ on , director of the United Nations Mission , said hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tali@@ ban have published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will take power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ son said , a strong role for women will enhance the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3,@@ 6 million voters .

G@@ MB &apos;s concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant by managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company kept silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is next to other products hob@@ bies and rich tea cookies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company manager , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB Senior Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we are not able to gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from the General @-@ Site @-@ Manager concerns our members deeply .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the Glasgow large area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advant@@ aged .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous engagement with employees and union representatives .
two months ago , we had regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the staff that we like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross headquarters , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may remind its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t let down in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after leaving a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ gio returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans insi@@ sted that the club always did its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um and his VW were on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese on the B 215 .
in the area of the town b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to move to the right .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides relief for Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse of abuse reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; according to the publication of the German press agency , he anticipated the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret on their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the events .
the Vatican newspaper Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; two measures &quot; were measured in the coverage of violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in regard to the infra@@ ction in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ pi@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion on keeping it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ pi@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also spoke in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we love going to the church and it is a fres@@ her . &quot;
she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; strikes were a very normal pedago@@ gical tool , &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for the past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , also Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says H@@ esh@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report written by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility , &quot; victim of assault , 67 domain cats .
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be stated that , in many cases , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has used forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion , the punishment for the students could also be more violent .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims inv@@ aded the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even had positive memories of him in spite of violence . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of drop@@ out of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how can you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name George R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all .
he is dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the horrible circumstances of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of his sphere of influence .
you can at best blame it , get too late or not take first hints seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all those sur@@ vey@@ ed - as literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
this is how the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; was always surrounded by children &apos;s grapes . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high level of emotion@@ ality which even led to break@@ through@@ s .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also distributed ear files and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted to years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , in the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as with teachers .
do you know such methods of breeding as well ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually contained in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it is not to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media rush@@ ed straight to him .
at the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , reports on abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen have been reported in the context of the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger find any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they do not even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , it is certainly not a conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
how do the cats scratch R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the abuse of mis@@ use ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able pup@@ il put it this way : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective offen@@ ders .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it seemed to him ... Bu@@ ben ever more intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment were familiar with it in advance , could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to talk about any complic@@ ity .
so he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; Weg@@ ner . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the reporting everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere in the midst of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
namely , there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence exc@@ esses as well as , we say , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally victi@@ mi@@ zed and suffered and suffered from it , all took place at the Vor@@ schule in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have ar@@ isen .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he had only to face the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um .
it was , as most of the witnesses pointed out , that the topic of &quot; primary school &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o .
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; conditions .
what was different in the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power .
and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in whom the report concludes that &quot; many sacrifices inv@@ alu@@ able the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous instances , even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
at the most it remains the reproach to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and of the processes at a school where he was not responsible and responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only back in 1993 .
does George R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the punishment punishment will continue to be practiced at the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , pun@@ ishable offen@@ ders had long been banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; historians talk about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the danger of assessing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right there .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was f@@ aded away in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that which was usual then .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally re@@ worked .
but at the same time Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take refuge , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. , to attract the ears of ear and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
what picture of his Regensburg time has George R@@ atz@@ inger cited in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope ? &quot;
was the subject of an audit sentence also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not by any means conc@@ ede that there was a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this too must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world @-@ class cultural ambassador , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and candy alone , the un@@ ru@@ ly boys do not make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of what area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .
what kind of person have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talking to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work in the book and in addition , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deep @-@ faith and heart@@ felt people , one cannot imagine that he could only do something for a fly .
I regularly get to know how many former Dom@@ sp@@ cats are still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who have not forgiven him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ cats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect@@ ful person , to which they still look and honor them today .
and please , once more clearly : all that is presented to him are educational methods which were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to go to the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report that was just published will relieve him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the stand would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would probably know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
