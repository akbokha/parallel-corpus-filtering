<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, which is now dug for the underground tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official map promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset already because the car-navy had a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavarian state government, are anything but current - but precisely why it is very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a flicketing carpet, which you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called premier papers, were incorporated into the large overview map for towns and communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian survey administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800, the French army leader occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although the French troops were finally withdrawn with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a surface-covering Bavarian map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph moved forward the project, set up the Topographical Bureau - and thus the Bavarian State Survey.</seg>
<seg id="19">The submission form for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is situated in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered flurpieces from the so-called "uranium" from which the Property Tax is derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "small plots yield no more farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "" "" "Land in Sun" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other hand of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositional Sheet, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at Gasteig" or the "lying on the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich circle-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüthi" was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was the head of the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended the accusations of so-called Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there had been room for the first time, and later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk-rentiary in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Youth in the Munich-based Salesianum meet on the grounds of the former prison institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football field of TSV Munich East, east residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural allusion to the original building of the Irreninstitution, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombings.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "Main Square" around 1856, the shopping street called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn commuter line takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Group of citizens publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which will come into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, race-based occurrences occur throughout the country and be noted here," said the Group's statement.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies, who disproportionately aim at minorities, prompted the group to issue the warnings issued by the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they will be beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, showing that black motorists in the state will stop 75 percent more often than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be ready to bring Caution Money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime report, which ranked the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warnings are also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities commit to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU's view of further race profiled.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher pasture fence project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right gradient of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-local association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann granted insights into his farm in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and housed in five apartments holiday resorts.</seg>
<seg id="72">For him, the "Black Forest" is the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales are on the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also chairman of the BLHV, he described the electric fence project as "essential."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit from such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area is a lot of work, a lot must be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "" "" "Schwendemann emphasized." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader-promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they can continue their operation," "" "" "" "the mayor stressed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticised for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced in by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">This means that the open-air area is 40 hectares, which must not be afforded up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of them were promoted by leaders, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">In this way, the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the durability of the fences," explains Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "Peter Weiss also noted:" "" "" "" "here, best food is produced." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state funding of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The pre-requisite is the presence of a subsidised by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be enclosed should not be tractor-controlled (inclination of more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The motion of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fischerbacher ordination project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-plan area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump stops the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firm Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller grabbed the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imiters would have been laughing if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it resorted to its importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta resonated: "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your idleness, your poor, and your oppressed masses who are longing to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time in which the" "" "" "" "miserable waste" "" "" "" "was better to see on our screens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: indeed, it is a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical imagery.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a disastrous attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservatives, who bring the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is advancing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The vast imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often horrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is all about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the UK athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butler - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "their speech was incredible," "" "" "" "says Black." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="143">"" "" "" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this path and last year he set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season which included victory with the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "extremely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being the special part of the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special to me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">As for my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are at the Olympiastadion again.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: don't mess around a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long before the papers struck him for all, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He complained about the criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "for in 1783 Washington said," "" "" "" "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astounding popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heatsink.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of persons coming to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum designated as official, and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post addressed with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney general Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I do not like this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are more likely to be disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "what the Governor's staff referred to as" "" "" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "" "" "would probably call" "" "" "" "intercession" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or releasing a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles, or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter recorders took the lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions who criticized his point of view on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overpower his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation.</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="259">An existing movement, which led to independence from the Dutch regime, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>

<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wood resources worth $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua people to ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost $20 million, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA leader Pruitt withdrew from the delaying of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">A day after being sucked by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency showed itself to the needs of state-state environmental authorities more responsive than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about a period that expired on 1 October for states to honour the 2015 standards of ozone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or impede economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was the Attorney General of Oklahoma prior to his appointment, was a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been persuaded to block or delay regulation, which opposed the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt foresaw that its reversal in ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for carrying out and then to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to determine the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take fridges seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and authority that gives us serious." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">Nevertheless, the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt will use its "power to delay and all other legally available authority" to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information. "</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress push for a more comprehensive collection of ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states who had sued EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," said Schneiderman.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius-Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius-Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Church of the Bergkirche, a serenade is invited to the old cemetary area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made the friends and promoters of Tumblgens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini points out: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in records in the Württembergische urn. count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen including the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or patronage belonged, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As evidenced from the description of the Oberamt of Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still to be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the dominant housing estate of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval private Church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, fitted out and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this self-reliance church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the Bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two shattered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later had to be left in 1942 during the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796, French troops were located near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823, the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower could be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm broke down the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius-plant from the "Schaffner Rentmeister" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumarc take part in the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, 16th July, to the sixth serenade.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo des Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann's place of origin speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">The closing of the serenade takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "" "" "the organizers highlight the fantastic view." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius installation, which is of great importance for Tumour and Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumblgens feel particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Boisheim defends itself" "" "" "" "does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council of Parliament." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim denies itself" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen only at the boundary of Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "" "" "such zones will prevent" "" "" "" "savings" "" "" "" "of the landscape." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but it did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf because of a mold error.</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legislation, the granted approval decision is still unlawful and therefore also recuperated," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval by the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle takes them to the occasion to examine the matter anew.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association "Boisheim."</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four four-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company in which the town of Viersen was indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that equates to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re will invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as an investment in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="804">Question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hoheiß and Sieber.</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the tablets should be added to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting the location.</seg>

<seg id="811">Also, in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see.</seg>
<seg id="812">The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014, the highest located observatory in northern Germany.</seg>
<seg id="813">According to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="815">Since 2003, at the initiative of the Göttingen Förderverein Planet, there is something similar to the planned Starbug - the Planetary Path.</seg>
<seg id="816">Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetary route leads with its stelae to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "off-planet" site in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.</seg>
<seg id="817">The stelae with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.</seg>
<seg id="818">The earth shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun exactly measures 75 meters away and measures 70 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="819">The entire distance of the planet's path amounts to just over four kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="820">While the light from Sun to Pluto needs about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of the Swedish asylum-seekers application tests released</seg>
<seg id="884">The recent test results of asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of tested people are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Ministry of Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalbonet) has started the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should take a closer look at the assessment of age during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Service (Migration Service) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">To date, migration cet 6.880 has been sent to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been steady in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we see no big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he told the magazine The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet submitted the 581 published results, she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of the medical age assessment, when x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work encompasses the evaluation of human biological maturity to see whether they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we can't say it, we should not do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said the newspaper Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency advocated the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">The biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent. "</seg>
<seg id="903">Fully in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the state road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are proceeding well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a total of seven tons of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Construction Manager at the Department of Public Transport and Transport in the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are built of red sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal attachment, which is also used as an operating way.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 meter wide bridge deck is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to go.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of pipes through the structure in Lauterbach required a particular feeling of intuition.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">Prior to the work, the local residents were informed about the project by handbooks.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">The traffic is regulated by a traffic light for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point towards Schramberg.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance the road is fully blocked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden."</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge renovations amounts to 700,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed through the country.</seg>
<seg id="931">AfD in Gerolstein: bunder protest with German potato salad</seg>
<seg id="932">It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented in the Kreifel Volcano (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad federation, which shows a peaceful flag on this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster "great campaign kick-out."</seg>

<seg id="937">Originally the town-picnic under the motto "All at a table" was planned at the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondells - and therewith directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.</seg>
<seg id="938">A colourful picture that is there.</seg>

<seg id="941">The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence especially at the railway station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.</seg>
<seg id="942">How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?</seg>
<seg id="943">Mario Hompes reported from the AfD Volcanic Eifel, he tried to make such an event and received the supplement.</seg>

<seg id="946">With a view to the event on the Rondellplatz square, he says: "this is the right people's right, the main thing, it remains peaceful."</seg>
<seg id="947">It also does that: at 20 o'clock a band for entertainment takes care of the Rondellplatz square, in the Stadthalle diverse speakers, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD-chairman Uwe Boy.</seg>
<seg id="948">There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy president Beatrix of Storch talk about their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">The AfD-Event takes a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 21 clock.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can crush - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Where the last resting-place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.</seg>

<seg id="1088">Germany discusses contaminated eggs.</seg>
<seg id="1089">How could the scandal happen?</seg>
<seg id="1090">How can consumers protect themselves?</seg>
<seg id="1091">The Minister of Agriculture, Christian Schmidt (CSU), is in an interview with the German editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="1092">Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?</seg>
<seg id="1093">I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp printing.</seg>
<seg id="1094">On the consumer protection portal www.essinung.de, the federal states present the latest information about the affected egg batches.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Also, if, according to all we know presently, a health risk is practically excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Is Aldi taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clarifier is not really perceived by the German Minister of Agriculture?</seg>
<seg id="1098">Food monitoring is the task of the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Nevertheless, my house has opened up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's concern.</seg>
<seg id="1100">All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.</seg>
<seg id="1101">Just like the manufacturers, trade has to take care that the products sold are marketable and harmless to health.</seg>
<seg id="1102">If the residual sugar content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in eggs, these are non-transferable.</seg>
<seg id="1103">Unpolluted eggs can, however, be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1104">This time the companies are not to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="1106">According to the current state of knowledge, production companies do not have immediate guilt.</seg>
<seg id="1107">On the contrary, they must reckon with economic damages due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.</seg>
<seg id="1108">As always, there is too little control in the case of serious accidents.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Is it just lacking at the staff or on the conclusive backwardness?</seg>
<seg id="1110">It was just the official controls that have revealed the process.</seg>
<seg id="1111">The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1112">It is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the handover to the prosecutors in cases where crimes can exist are of decisive importance.</seg>

<seg id="1118">In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the position of foodborne animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels.</seg>
<seg id="1120">I expect all relevant authorities that the facts will be enlightened quickly and comprehensively.</seg>
<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded editions of the European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to get the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar receives a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">With security, PSG can make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to acquire players, but must counteract with legitimate means of revenue which allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs which had enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentrating on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich, originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year renewal period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to discourage excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will continue to amplify the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, against The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the bill for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the redemption rate for the next five years can be stated in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of EU sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (back then $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Qatari company may sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come on payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 contested that Neymar WM ambassador will become ambassador and could easily figure out such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG would mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, said Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financially doping "with the club and the state," said President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last shareholding to PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sport tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the overall landscape of the football in the last 15 years," "" "" "" "said Wenger on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new source supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced Frey Board Chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the long-term cooperation is at a possible end: the airline cancels the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">On request of the news agency SDA, Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very happy with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Each year, some 17 million small, red-white, red-white chocolate tablets distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss didn't want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northwestern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But even more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tender." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers can answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract in the spring of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the largest chocolate manufacturer was not achievable for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros's daughter Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The possibility to place the logo took place two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long-haul flights, the First Class customers are pampered with treats from the Sprüngli Confiserie, in the Business Class's passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Also on the short circuit, Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey distributes both business and economy class.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-year-Grunge era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter called the Sketch-comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By getting into the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play cool kids who are grown up - nevertheless they created the impossibility of winning the last part of the Witzes back.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten years Later," with his adults playing adults now, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more on the principle of watering, including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character rumbles through an Apple-Powerbook, some Inline Skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy malicious plot, included in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see Mr. Rudd's eternal young, Matt Dillons underlippage from "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">These are the moments of accidental delusion that could preheat this franchise as a way of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War by "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde," and even "GLOW" with its East-West wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director gives a missing TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game "Finde out the voice."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was reduced to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire as Gregor and Iosef are repeatedly visiting the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a forage for a scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictive Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.</seg>

<seg id="1215">In Italy, two persons were arrested in the case of raids in Italy.</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over a rise.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the bank voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflation forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and by 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to just under 3% in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1267">But she signalled that in the coming years interest increases would be necessary to rein the inflation heated by the Brexit and she said that the cost of borrowing might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>

<seg id="1291">"" "" "" "patients will receive access to a" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" transformative "" "" "" "" HIV prevention treatment after a fight against the High Court in the NHS. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by healthcare to a first three-year study for valued 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling of the Supreme Court last year, confirming that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October, before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Pretext prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in Infectious Diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who come into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is signed £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bank manager with a passion for real estate, contracted in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">Located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make full use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "" "" "he explains." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms to be stacked on top of each other, without having to bend." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold pieces, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units for all seating and jars from Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineering" "" "" "" "went in there," "" "" "" "explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF-door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is counterweight so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is valued," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the soil." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to increase the floor space while simultaneously using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and that can help create an emotional bond within a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you do not love electrical outlets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "" "" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metergeof some standard in something quite Amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a confrontation with one of the largest real estate agents in Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place at the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family in 1973 bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the Stadtsenrum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1364">A judiciary notes that this means Colin's property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>

<seg id="1388">New Chief of Staff Trump plans to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even track.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television is decades back - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "" "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg against Politico in February." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump Twitter habitual under control, according to six former electoral civil servants, insists that his personal media consumption entails a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something, which we do not know others - that trumps tweets would have even more combustible material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble for a few times, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that the people in a White House composed of competing parties will always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">In May, POLITICO - fully engaged in this story - reported on the preference of advisers to provide doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with damaged leaks, and that it is stiffening from where they come from." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This is exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article written by Gottar.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to "be the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has uttered false accusations in the past and revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump reading the article and began questioning employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the district council office as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>

<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also magnifies more and more trumps in private and business environments.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the special promoter Trump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accusation whether the president could possibly obstruct the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to prove the present evidence in potential cases of crime and to decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Therefore, Grand juries are also called Prosecutors.</seg>

<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump.</seg>

<seg id="1509">Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rustification, allegations against Trump had become loud, he wanted to impede justice.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey spoke in front of a Senate committee in June, Trump asked him for a setting up of the investigations against Michael Flynn, the national security adviser at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg driving in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg has become detached from the Schelfeiture's almost seven-fold size.</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The Koloss, which weighs on a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for man does not come from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the departure of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for some 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeiture so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this ice shelf the balance of waxes and abrupt was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a complete horseshoe is broken down there," "" "" "" "writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never moved as far as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can crumble if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and icebergs does not increase the level of sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can flow more quickly than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could increase the sea level, but only to a lesser extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It drops off regularly there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the most important withdrawal since the beginning of records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will now grow again or retire in the long term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers did not take back the break-off of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, however, in the past few decades many ice hooves of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees and is therefore one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis alert came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," said the organisation in an opinion on social media.</seg>

<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Jugend fortet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that his crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are supplied to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart, so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's record, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of exposing themselves to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs, involved in search and rescue missions, have so far been prepared to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1683">"hook up, jump from a building, get yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day prior to Audi's announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW chairwoman said the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars will be modified in Europe in order to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Neither of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutralization of exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of impeding the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was, at times, one of the most publicized cartoonists, the nodules of his characters are his trademark.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message:" "" "" "" "laughter," "" "" "" "because there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the early years as an artist he suggested, among other things, as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came through at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish murdillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning he reportedly sits still at the draughtsch according to his own information, works daily for nearly ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendar, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks continue to find its cute characters worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands as a counterpart.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence under threat of climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is declining because of drought-reminding conditions and insect-borne insects, which prepares scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and in autumn much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the lifetime of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cichade, a microbacterial which transfers the dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And much is at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "" "" "so we have fewer parts with essential oil." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resilient to drought.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The town of Geisa in Thuringia is celebrating its 1200 anniversary this year.</seg>
<seg id="1807">The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat to Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodocice usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no respite of violence, and while throughout the country the bodies pile up, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas, is among the latter.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hung on the facade of the Riodox building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Federal Attorney Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodox, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everybody." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the Riodox newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug queens that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "calm" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodocice, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the children, presumed vein-members bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country after the confiscation of another newspaper publishing the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the establishment of Riodov and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters dared to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodox, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPI Award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must take over the task that comes to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodox team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "" "" "now they ask:" "" "" "" "was his love for routine to ruin his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they do not like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret runways and runways" "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, said the editor of the Riodov Andres Villarreal that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">Days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and militants in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the Riodox offices in a four-storey building in a middle class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who were not trustworthy of the Governor himself.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for this week's edition, Riodox has concentrated on three main stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures, which concentrated on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that abducted a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost the entire century on all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-profile cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about preceding incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, readers of Valdez's column were regarded as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees became something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to the office of the prosecutor for another journalist next morning.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder throughout the country by subtracting "SOS Press" in organised protests on pavements and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since urged her to be reorganized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the "Articulo 19" media group assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists from the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth," "" "" "" "said Ramirez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her Director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists escaped from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>

<seg id="1924">Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well received that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in "Current Biology" described it as "the preserved armored dinosaur that was ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Its incredibly well preservative state has been amazed by researchers who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) of heavy soil clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurus." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a shifting tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better blend in his surroundings and avoid his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was driven by sufficient pressure through carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than spoils, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators of the Cretaceous period have been," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on pointers on his life, including his conserved Darminhaltes, to find out what he ate as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South-florida today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable, since it is completely covered with preserved flaky skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretan era." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only look a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is asleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the observable armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from muzzle to hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes, which were resting from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur preserved his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautrests still cover even bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a gain in Lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I get it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armour plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or otherwise a document that must be referenced.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the part or large room and delays in the control of his own tickets and the conductor takes the time to take care of other matters.</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th.</seg>

<seg id="2062">As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tucker and Haarlem, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence service provider kissed a 35-year prison sentence after opening secret diplomatic news about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">With the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just hit by the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal Briphews, which, over the course of two years, exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Suppose Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would deliver judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama, in fact, only a few days after the book was published, would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy encounter.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something profound and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump manages a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces, in order to find new, tweetable paths in order to further flare the rigid circuits he should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning challenged with her overwhelming signature (the "i" in her surname is marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic splintering," the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome will not take care of who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic book.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as it appears with a hands-free phone in the hands of the disciplinary powers of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if they make your speech cold, then they have won," "" "" "" "it says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "so never stop the mouth." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she was to do it, then she will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, from her own genomic simulakras that clash like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2, Manning's stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.</seg>
<seg id="2157">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University, sought for murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">A countrywide chase is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who are looking for suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued warrants for murder on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as demonstrated by the acts of the District Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bites.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the event, and Detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police are actively seeking the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that she was now in absence and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is now a criminal affair examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University co-operates with this investigation," "" "" "" "said Cubbage." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to submit to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip, said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents: "the police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and research a variety of motifs, including a possible domestic incident."</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutko's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted to problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees in your e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulently.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply no consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She has called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up race is growing up to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, provide specialist groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-Suite executives and address themselves directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where's the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-in surveys and surveys of certain teams, it provides a company's heat card that shows which units have most of the ailments and which managers have low approval results so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber wrapped in Skandale, since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of annoyance where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">This wish is a lucrative business opportunity for start-ups such as GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convergence has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent allows companies to send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has employed Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practicalities.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can approach this holistic, 360 degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "" "" "but it took until the" "" "" "" "Social Media" "" "" "" "came to their right" "" "" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convergence received $10 million in funding in February of firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November of Bessemer's Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there is a growing set of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that has heard their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns if their portfolio companies are running well. companies are working well when employees are engaged and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the third-party analytics tools promise third-party commitment and commitment, it's no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can demotify disappointment and demotivise employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4000 discussions," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for if you don't follow, staff ask," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care why I should?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, has been able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company has always received new insights about the employees, and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bonding of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three sessions of UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hybridle heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) deliberates on pensions and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The meeting was attended by the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2344">That was the number of civilians in the YAS in the overpopulation.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government forces the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff of Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the officers of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were deposed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup d'état, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wiper of the attempted coup.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 persons, who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, has been negotiated in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had designated the coup attempt as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "fully cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Uneasiness to the Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, wrote the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the help of the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan steered another 7395 state servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times, they appealed their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan urged the military to step backward step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is purposefully pushing forward the Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a particularly unnamed officer, who sought asylum in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt, warned the Turkish army in a few years "full extremists and salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If that is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.</seg>
<seg id="2363">In any case, there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army in the alliance after the purges.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to clean track for the shuttle bus</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months, over the past few months, over the future of the race ticket has been contested - now it is supposed to be quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year, the track on which the tourist railway is going to be built will be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the railway ticket in the long term, construction works will start on the track this year according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to continue ordering and refurbishing the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country commits itself to this important connection, especially for tourism," explained traffic jam secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of the repair of the route was about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country overtook 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being voted for final approval, said Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are traded," "" "" "" "said Sühl." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This means that the race track shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The race track shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, in the course of a pilot operation, it has been tested whether the route is used by a large number of people in order to re-order them regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The route is also very steep in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The ascension of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that it can't become more crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people are funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more often," "" "" "" "said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexdolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions, which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the robot's eye colour to the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepwise woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexdolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best as possible," "" "" "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "she can be tired, be fixed to conversation or she can be" "" "" "" "in mood" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the subservient female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, trouble one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its origin and increasing sophistication refer to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course do not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notices their growing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is transpiring from the fringes can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the swallowed body and the poke eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, imitating the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their personalities, the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing suggesting independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to put it in the 2017 phraseology: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps Major Performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a maxim of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">There were newspapers around Christmas and Thanksgiving in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all reportedly demanding to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a linksy poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the republican relationship with which she fought for decades, suddenly and completely independently on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but I notice in another context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the end of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we talk about "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer run away.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the Right wing are "normalized," suddenly appearing in comparison to his standards suddenly as the concept of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself surrounded by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump walks, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels of the New York car park, and the best three bucks that can be spent in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twist to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clipping music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel still is a strange magic experience, as two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women can walk on it in the 40's and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need arises.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing grinning, while I was tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius, for the second time, left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrists. according to the prison authorities he suffered a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Due to murder following an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first murderer.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he had his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time to Pistorius Appell's six-year prison sentence, which they say is too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the National Prosecution Service said they will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslach's Mayor, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written out - however, suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">For the past 31 years, Wacker has been Mayor of Stadtbaumeister.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun, as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He tells of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time it is surprising that no application has required the requirement profile so far.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach functions as the lower building rights authority for the Administrative Committee, the applicant must present relevant agreements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">This function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would no longer be able to fill it out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2557">As the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what is purposeful" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city building master stresses.</seg>

<seg id="2559">"" "" "" "he is a builder," "" "" "" "in the end everything runs here over my table." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">With care and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for 15 years.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you would like to be buried by Roland Wacker, according to the city of Haslach, you should have completed a degree in degree as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor of Arts in the field of architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction planning and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study is just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and UK 300,000 causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not invade the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their entrails.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an intolerant diet rich in tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system works in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same family, which had been separately accommodated, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial flavors of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were taken up in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system, the researchers caused L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice lining, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestines." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "" "" "potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2623">As the wind is turning: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD boss, Social-Democratic ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern.</seg>
<seg id="2624">But no storrage from the party headquarters, but no headwind from the federal government - so the most important wish of the election fighters was lurking.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the employees of Willy-Brandt-Haus are watching the events in the SPD-governed state capitals with increasing horror.</seg>

<seg id="2633">Five months before the country's election, his red-green coalition lost its one-votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>

<seg id="2635">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the transfer to the CDU signifies a clear falsification of voters" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Tire must immediately return her mandate, "said the Federal managing director and election campaign manager of the Green Party editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"it must not be true," an SPD election champion sighs when the new obscene message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony, stands for the transfer of the green Members of Elke Twesten there to the CDU without their own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and minor crises in the SPD state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what's next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Misere started with the unexpectedly sharp defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, the comrades were reassuring at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">This became - and indeed everything was much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into wrappers, the Düsseldorf-Pleigh slipped the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades in the weeks had laboriously scrambled back.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just exhausted new courage, the G-20 summit was held by Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next blow.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD member of the SPD, lost his Nimbus this weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in the crisis communication he made everything wrong, which one can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then Scholz has been fighting for its political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW-Exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony already stood in the criticism for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Myese survey values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or maybe just for this reason, Weil has always tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin, too, did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They allowed him to grant him a stabilisation of the party.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Weil meets the party-internal pressures of the Lower Saxony Greens basically no fault.</seg>

<seg id="2664">Mrs. Twesten there has been elected parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but on the national list of the Lower Saxony Greens, so the Lower Saxony deputies continue.</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to sane their coming home in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On top of this, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg City Development were in touch on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been several renovation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At the time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous refurbishments are a "successful project" - it is also important to promote the interior development, not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a redevelopment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 came from the country, the rest from the community of sensations.</seg>

<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out objectively, i.e. per property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for the funding has been running until 30 April 2026 since January 1, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey would be carried out only once, in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the resolution must be made as soon as possible, so that the restoration can begin in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each commune must carry out the said preliminary investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen provides relief for Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church," according to the publication of the German press agency, he anticipated the former Regensburg Bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the cathedral kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret on their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano, on the other hand, criticised that "two measures" were measured in the coverage of violence in the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the infraction in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scarpiaffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday life and prepares the public opinion on keeping it normal" "" "" "", "writes Scarpiaffia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also spoke in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we love going to the church and it is a fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that in her youth "strikes were a very normal pedagogical tool," to cope with cheeky children as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards for the past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, also Pope-brother George Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Heshemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report written by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, "with high plausibility," victim of assault, 67 domain cats.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be stated that, in many cases, Domkapellmeister R. has used forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotion, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims invaded the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even had positive memories of him in spite of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of dropout of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "" "" "on the one hand, many students highlight his" "" "" "" "humanity" "" "" "". "" "</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How can you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name George Ratzinger is in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages, and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrible circumstances of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool were also expropriated outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can at best blame it, get too late or not take first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all those surveyed - as literally - "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">This is how the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "was always surrounded by children's grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high level of emotionality which even led to breakthroughs.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also distributed ear files and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted to years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such methods of breeding as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually contained in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the preschool, these are Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media rushed straight to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, reports on abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen have been reported in the context of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger find any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "" "" "I said," "" "" "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they do not even trust their parents and siblings, it is certainly not a conductor who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the cats scratch Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse of misuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable pupil put it this way: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it seemed to him... Buben ever more intrusive or clearer or even more open than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "" "" "that the students and / or their environment were familiar with it in advance, could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">So far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to talk about any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate a good name with these conflicting crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "" "" "in the media much of" "" "" "" "non-violence" "" "" "" "was read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegner."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the reporting everything has been mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere in the midst of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence excesses as well as, we say, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were literally victimized and suffered and suffered from it, all took place at the Vorschule in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have arisen.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he had only to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatz gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It was, as most of the witnesses pointed out, that the topic of "primary school" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that "many sacrifices invaluable the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous instances, even associate positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he just started to establish himself and of the processes at a school where he was not responsible and responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does George Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out that" "" "" "" "the punishment punishment will continue to be practiced at the pre-school." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, punishable offenders had long been banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "" "" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "" "" "historians talk about" "" "" "" "achronism" "" "" "", "the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was faded away in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that which was usual then.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it is finally reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time Georg Ratzinger must take refuge, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e., to attract the ears of ear and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his Regensburg time has George Ratzinger cited in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of an audit sentence also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domspatzen played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not by any means concede that there was a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this too must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class cultural ambassador, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the unruly boys do not make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of what area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person have you experienced Georg Ratzinger in talking to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work in the book and in addition, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep-faith and heartfelt people, one cannot imagine that he could only do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get to know how many former Domspcats are still today, 23 years after his Emeritierung, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspcats are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still look and honor them today.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that is presented to him are educational methods which were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to go to the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for the report that was just published will relieve him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand would command a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
