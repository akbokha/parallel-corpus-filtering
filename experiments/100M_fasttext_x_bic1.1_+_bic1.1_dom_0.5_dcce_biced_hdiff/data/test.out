28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the court medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was class@@ ed as murder and the investigations are underway .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS S@@ GO station in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston , had claimed his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a tight family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived initially in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
combining his way with his family was to always cook something to prepare us for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the event will be asked to call the Yellow Wag@@ on of the S@@ F@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star in an interview is now un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or stuck from outside label which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are more modest to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of a TV with delicious de@@ bris and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women need not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film takes place on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyrami@@ ds of sport &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted home at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p to the feed @-@ consoles .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with that the riding career then ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
he was led with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even ho@@ ver for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen at a small gala the Golden Sport pyramid .
the li@@ ke@@ able sports@@ man does not lack any distin@@ ctions .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ ne lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already rebu@@ ked him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US champion was added to the Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports on Saturday .
among the drawn signs are the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company went to the Spring@@ ste@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Award went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump economic policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - we want Clinton as well as Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
der , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump refuses to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claimed Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive up regulations substantially , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton says , on the other hand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has privileged opportunities to open up and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the taxes on the rich would increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the case of investment , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost wor@@ dless .
the democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are being strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
in other words , some internal discussions could be made on tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re@@ fuel coal mining in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly strengthen and demand renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign either .
at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better .
they should be paid even better , says Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point out that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to ask the rich , is asking them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing themselves , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house has a refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few decentr@@ alised lod@@ gings for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - either not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other reasons for the escape in women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
anyone who believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , mis@@ ses , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , all standing women in refugee shel@@ ters are often regarded as inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the apartment in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what has happened , because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not know how to help , more accommodation is needed only for them , B@@ ahr calls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some with no answer to the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction .
there is no such thing as government accommodations in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government , says that even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors or houses in some common buildings only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s rights and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or if both men and women are accommod@@ ated , it can - continuously - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is available in the study .
as much as the women feel this need for protection , one can read off the crowd that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us to exist , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily build a second house .
assistant doctors fight : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
assistant doctors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new combat actions in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work @-@ fighting measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that it would have been appointed ministers to respond to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; about problems , which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and call for official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal proposal to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work steps that began in early September .
the disputes led that assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A Assistance specialists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students , that the contract should be advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow@@ ly rib@@ bed and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there was never anything worse .
his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s em@@ bla@@ zing , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the down@@ fall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was sky@@ rock@@ eted .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia &apos;s back .
the off@@ ence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend .
building up the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late season ons@@ lau@@ ght at the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports were allowed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power is considered a weak response .
in addition , the sustained res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ qu@@ ed , is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relations with the West .
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit meeting in this prestigious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to demonstrate how it once seemed to me an analy@@ st to depic@@ t &quot; an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel off@@ beat and badly treated and are now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents expressed themselves at the press conference that they wouldn &apos;t even have stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state should at least speak together again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Board Chairman of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and rescu@@ ed eight years ago .
in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized headquarters and the listing on stock exchange are to be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private client business that are getting more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as the brand where our employees will be engaged , as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that its six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer carry on and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands , because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chairman of the Executive Board .
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these trademarks again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings it 3.@@ 000@@ th gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market on Friday .
he put a mil@@ eage on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night at Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which was trained by John Gos@@ bone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who achieves the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before G@@ ha@@ yy@@ am , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened to New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ ering when he gets ahead of the dile@@ mma
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career star@@ ters
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only a few reached before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for race , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enth@@ r@@ alled by fans for many years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago with Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already been a winner in the UK for almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from flying f@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties initially when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doubts and return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori had once said that he wants to continue at competitions up to his age of at least 50 years .
Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the stric@@ test confidence circle of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is said that without stating reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been his deputy since 2012 , was named as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it reads ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV broad@@ caster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was long time one of the closest confi@@ dan@@ te Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so , is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official claim - that a man who once was praised as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; it is true that I asked you to talk to me at the beginning of 2012 , this very complicated post - you could almost say - tru@@ sting posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V assumed the position in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as Putin , former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
once it was assumed that according to Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term would viol@@ ate Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another late Putin &apos;s ally , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement his dis@@ miss@@ al .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son is written out of the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with him since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and spent the last twelve years in my heart blood , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now .
I would like to thank the writers , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .

Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate operation that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the deck &apos;s deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high and low construction .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the extension of the North Tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the land side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern spreading bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive yet very delicate activity .
massive , because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate , because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck still alive &quot;
three men were &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; after they were thrown at Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded an alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat was moving out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast rescue boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it was released from the person who controlled the boat .
someone today w@@ akes up about these men .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .

she then al@@ armed its sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .

when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens think that investors should be put far more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build cheap apartments ?
so far a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ st@@ believed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments will have to be furnished as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the inventory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private plots ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , will provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ st@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
despite this , viol@@ a , a tightening of the situation in the housing market has van@@ ished .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of another 1300 beneficial apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
there will be 500 apartments alone by the year 2020 .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm should now be bought from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing flats back to the price binding .
this is possible in the West city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
because in the West city Fri@@ sten runs out at the end of the year .
around 1800 the apartments could be returned to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : that &apos;s what the owners , the housing companies do not want .
because the number of social housing in the West city is drastically increased again , one is far from the goal of so @-@ called &quot; mixing &quot; .
it is no longer a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged neighbor@@ hoods in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their spare time on star@@ ing on screens has been pla@@ stered by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that the technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later on a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , can be &quot; photographed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the cell phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger joined the j@@ ahn and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game led to a considerable rise in incre@@ ments that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back each day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who train 30 minutes each day , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for the increase in performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to get &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people looking miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
those who exercise regularly can reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also ir@@ regul@@ arities that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could go against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even though Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and the use will fade away with time .
however , based on poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , more active , and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ ort@@ lessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast cl@@ apped to the championship title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team@@ mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es sculp@@ ts on the balance beam during the single multi @-@ fight event of women in the artistic gymnas@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a championship title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the last three years , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected her last exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight arena of women during the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clam@@ ation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ ly insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long journey to the top , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition for a competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ a was slightly led by two turns , the picture was clou@@ dy .
ho@@ vering beams and floor plans - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - was l@@ ur@@ king .
she returned with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the ho@@ vering beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor he sat on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her death - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ ly bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called O@@ ma , had a head start .
after her ground exercise she was cast down by the crowd , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which at times seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in cars in serial kill@@ ings in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report .
the police announced that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims .
the spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks and two more were injured in h@@ is@@ panic residential areas within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .

a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting that dump@@ ed on an empty truck half an hour before the triple murder and it is assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found bul@@ lets and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like most of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund H@@ ep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself into that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course one has left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can walk with help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; As@@ sing something to me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on his own .
Micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what is going to happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause for ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency stop on Friday .
numerous rivers in southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flood their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floods after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that civil servants are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags were increasing .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while in the Mobile area it was still ra@@ ining .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger as these streams flow only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the beaten rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi national border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still recru@@ ited people from floo@@ ding water in the areas of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near the globe on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek water , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water streaming and streaming in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ at@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a flood of river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he was the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly , as there were still severe ra@@ ins and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground was considerably reduced by rainf@@ all since Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities indicated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and lesson loss in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now both flooded .
the Chief of the Rob@@ by Miller community said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven animals washed from floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags were provided for the inhabitants who hope to be able to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses should have been reported on Thursday as floo@@ ding , but on Friday no reports have been reported .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bla@@ sted by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police announced that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in the hospital during his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators divided C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked back to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ looked the scene of the crime .
it seems that this is definitely an ongoing battle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were h@@ ul@@ ls .
in this way it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police cut@@ ters Anthony G@@ inal@@ di to the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and police re@@ port@@ edly insp@@ ected the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a squee@@ z@@ ebo@@ at on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I put forward under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ning and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly , this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had an inspiring effect for many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catholic , round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female gym@@ n@@ ast was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic med@@ alist and America che@@ ered .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful sc@@ ary routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold in an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so do gymnas@@ tics in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to take part in the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that Tur@@ nen is a cost@@ lier sport and gym@@ na@@ sts primarily in private gym@@ n@@ astic societies which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the gym@@ na@@ sts maintain their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started doing gymnas@@ tics .
we have to offer the municipalities au@@ n countless young girls , inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach turn@@ out training .
I founded my gym@@ n@@ ast of 20 years .
in my events we offer free and affordable walking in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic clu@@ b@@ team and thanks for motiv@@ ating her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted on a vote refused .
in July , Hun@@ t had unveiled plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the nursing care .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance doctors said last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have still raised serious concerns to the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and deliver it to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts made by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through discussions caused the government to participate and sometimes on a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had just done last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise awareness and address the worries of assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work @-@ fighting measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a resp@@ ite of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and doctors were involved to cover doctors on the strip chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ point for the 5@@ 4,000 assistants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , general director of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistants to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work @-@ fighting measures achieve nothing of the only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for patients , car@@ ers and their families only worry , need and interruption . &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from professional training , training knots , mutual recognition of curriculum , continuing education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after it has been recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for individuals with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended four years of in@@ gest@@ ing to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended four years of in@@ gest@@ ing to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year , and a quarter of these suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form deposits .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the flow of blood to the heart and cause a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is marketed under the bri@@ li@@ que trade name , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month consumption of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack .
through a provisional recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture revi@@ ves election sc@@ ams in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for a government report on corruption from office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to ignor@@ ing widespread election sc@@ ams in Muslim communities as a crush@@ ing government report today revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Local Government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off bands outside of electoral boo@@ ths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a vot@@ er must mention his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they release their votes to prevent someone to vote twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only to electoral fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a consequence of Tower Ham@@ lets Choice Award in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor , Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , was to be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia alle@@ gations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the result of im@@ itation where one person chooses to be somebody else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm regarding the frau@@ dul@@ ent postal voting - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the conduct of IDs to prove their identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on political activists to process postal voting documents to stop &quot; harvesting . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the election list@@ ings being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing to check your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as it has left its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic postal voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition of political activists to process full postal voting and envel@@ opes from postal voting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off for election stations .
a change in the law facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act ( 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral districts ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go on their own in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls across the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; astonishing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal complaint has been made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy to be un@@ fit for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high demands of the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ ups &quot; of the electoral registration departments of the town halls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities threaten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous doubles of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have gu@@ essed this week by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ han@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but this summer , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ans is far from the only athlete to fight Gold Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous double @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the moment on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Paraly@@ mp@@ ics that are more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
hunter and wolf : team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the race track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi &apos;s Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see much simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ ski@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big , expressive eyes is said to be a double @-@ han@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African Flo@@ at Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a walk higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ wich , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ all@@ ist Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the tan @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan was att@@ ested by fans to resemble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others have also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory is put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float dropped &quot; like Low , &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he released his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle floating relay .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been taken on board in the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
too excited , as he claimed , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the floating relay 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators throughout Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language .
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died like a pig ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not captured that they were still on stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , at which he made many speeches .
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let &apos;s look like ra@@ cists . # was disgu@@ sted .
shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 visits to people who responded to the news on Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed and released a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on show and our followers in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal assault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Flo@@ at in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ tra@@ ged by a woman who sham@@ elessly attempts to wash under@@ wear in the middle of his business
the buyer did not know where to go , when a woman went out to dress her clothes in the middle of a mark to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ in@@ ised them , as she looked at it , pulled them out and put them back to the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she started to dance and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took out a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled off their own trousers and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , started to dance and go out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bother anyone watching - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the trousers she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as opposed to thinking that someone would take home pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to pull out the clothes after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she was not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn your predat@@ or around the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should turn out first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move out of the gun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with his knee in the l@@ ath and twist while the attack@@ er cl@@ ashes with pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they align the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , grab the weapon and rotate it so that the Att@@ acker doesn &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
traveler Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler subjected his immune system and th@@ aus@@ age to a serious test by le@@ ver@@ aging some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ dic@@ ated his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before completing each object , he used a l@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he was going to do .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light .
the idea to lick off the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr W@@ right spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily , nothing left out what he no@@ d@@ ded , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known for testing the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public funds at stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task put its immune system definitely below a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was justified in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial under@@ score showed a lumin@@ ary number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ escent number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their lumin@@ escent number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here , because here it is disgu@@ sting .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the development of gut bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had directed him , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others , with whom this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well being of the stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation with a damage of £ 50,000 because it terror@@ ised their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ by and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the property owners shocked the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls were g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is as well .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , disputes and cur@@ ses included .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly ph@@ oned the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , stated that it would have been given the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the community house .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant det@@ ested to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the last step into consideration in Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ ving on the floor
house@@ keeping workers will now have to clean out garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in trade @-@ intent .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will del@@ o@@ ge rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row was told by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ tion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without blame as well as to those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after an eff@@ ig@@ ent military jet over@@ flew the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the Air Force deployed an incredible crash flight
the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic after a ti@@ ghter jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed when they began to worry about the noise of the utilities without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the airplane would drop down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so low that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet was flying slightly deeper than usual due to the poor visibility conditions in the vicinity , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on the island of Madeira died too .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly as low as possible due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke smoke , which restric@@ ts his view
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen performs in most other applications .
before the first mandatory match of the new season there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ s@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
Sevilla in turn has the 2 : 3 defeat following extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to win the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in an own league of table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title def@@ ender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ way final .
this brought the world rank@@ ist first to the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ hal@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final match and made the title to each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would clin@@ ch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea was the last non @-@ Chinese participant at the top of the Olympic Games .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and with time outs , they had no coaches with them .
they had retired to the grand@@ stand and left their cont@@ ests alone in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have played the matches here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said lo@@ gically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally un@@ il@@ ateral .
Ma had to fight only in the first set with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
after that he determined the speed on the plate and dropped Z@@ hang on only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
but nevertheless there were enough stunning ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ ali@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ a@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ Russian bred a rib@@ bed injury , and after that he had to deal with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympic @-@ Fourth in similarly high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits to ″ massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former repub@@ li@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own repub@@ li@@ can camp , there are now doubts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in key states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bl@@ aming false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media group .
repub@@ li@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , Tr@@ ump and his cur@@ ator had been syn@@ onymous with the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front but not with the gap common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia also are considered to be endangered .
in an interview with Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes no difference as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to cancel funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not present any better survey values .
instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger under arms for the Congress .
Olympia : three sc@@ am in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face a threat after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
Kenya has sent a trainer to Kenya following a fraud control in the Olympic Village .
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary reported that the former S@@ printer and current Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , released a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented itself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; explained Mr K@@ eni@@ as chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of He@@ ads Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , the IO@@ C has long been under special surveillance following numerous dop@@ ing regulations .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly claimed that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently asked for a similar study in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was possible to prove that this type of sport has been comprehen@@ sively and systematically supp@@ ressed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
accompanied by a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room .
the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he he@@ ats .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members Tony &apos;s love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli is back with the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his gaze , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time , the Pu@@ y@@ kan@@ ers went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful as it was then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family had learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she came to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London went on a plane to Turkey and then took a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says that in case of a winning victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain the candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , Leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will nom@@ inate the successor of the de@@ ceased judge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman for Rei@@ d said later that he had not yet talked with Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gary and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge of the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants neck calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere in order to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of top models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine differs from Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it does the calendar also .
&quot; we must return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish cal@@ endar@@ s .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community pays tribute to mass tourism
&quot; those who do not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons on short notice with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , even &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; could become , the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
due to the harsh action of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany awaits a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had already out@@ stri@@ pped Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ actions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey are fle@@ eing .
after the vain coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan will want to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or driven out in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria positioned against Erdo@@ gan and its adher@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , too , there is a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critic .
for the first time I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire @-@ marking as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer anni@@ hil@@ ates teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not fit and praise Erdo@@ gan are sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and s@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
just as the newspaper reports on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks set up the largest group of asylum holders approved for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this was 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and therefore almost 29 per cent of all eligible for asylum @-@ seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey there are not those seen before war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go to where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shall not vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 the Parliament &apos;s election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
as stupid as yet it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the election fighters , are on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not indigenous , so don &apos;t choose the Land@@ tag .
there are some practical problems : hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ atable ballo@@ ons and fl@@ yers out fl@@ yers .
until the 4th of September , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to make election campaigns just over the people .
the hot phase , if you can tell it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in poll@@ s clear behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how strong newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ality .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one can see from his large posters .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and talks a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
apart from that , Se@@ ering received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the wan@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already seen how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel federal election circuit is located in the northeast .
but the target audience did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , general secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR .
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign stand@@ ings at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
this , according to Kok@@ ert , only plays a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot;
the Union also noted that in the country you are crum@@ bling the basis that it must be very demanding to find a wire to the people again .
it goes like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where the people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Social Democrats la@@ gged behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only margin@@ ally ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had already won clearly with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday necessity and transfer their election campaign largely to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she calls the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in other words , green campaig@@ ners go on search for traces of local voters under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ ls with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the lakes of Mecklenburg and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 - Ref@@ ur@@ b@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
there is always praise for those responsible for the construction work that starts at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and only ends at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning .
&quot; they did everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week to the south , and everything will be ready by the end of October .
he also v@@ owed the receipt of those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the setup of shopping trips .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ s@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg continued , the traffic situation in the place was relaxed .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ s@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive movement through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; said Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King responsible for the project management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas become fran@@ tic .
since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality increasingly called for the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there have been considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself very know@@ led@@ geable on the spot .
two to three per minute have been flash@@ ed .
the fastest one was at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to break@@ through@@ s in them allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for other companies , has hardly any consequences for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; at most slight drop , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; the running show is missing . &quot;
the most powerful are the local restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words .
this is exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates the sales losses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the street reconstruction has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be dismissed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted otherwise .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ clientele comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; construction works six months , which is already brutal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , the name of the fight against terrorism is being scre@@ wed to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a dump@@ ing status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ eh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not over@@ burden anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he is located in results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ tain@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions on security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security agency will take care of the un@@ locking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck out jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that the coalition partner has any chance anyway .
a few new ideas are also presented by de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have in themselves : he plans screening for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are being targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of den@@ unci@@ ation for rejected asylum seek@@ er , he wants to make some worse than to date - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to mask their identity .
some of these are politically and legally sanc@@ tified .
some of them are still un@@ balanced and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly dealt with could not be cl@@ otted out in election ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal security has moved enormously into the focus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral struggles .
with regard to internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly moving into position .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ chy argument about the equipment of the federal police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort leaders also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also struggles here for conci@@ li@@ atory notes .
he thinks nothing of a return from the double pass .
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
it is not sensible to re@@ plen@@ ish it .
and he has constitutional obj@@ ections to a bur@@ ka prohibition .
whether its own package at all corners is un@@ constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first be shown .
there is a lot of stuff in it , which could take care of stri@@ fe .
but even the SPD is currently trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party chief Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signs a cau@@ tious willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Volkswagen is still getting worse .
in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , deliveries are increasing worldwide .
but it does not run around in all markets .
with the recall action , there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen is launching more restra@@ ined terms in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel generation , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus , despite the diesel generation , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , VW &apos;s core brand was weaker , especially in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales , as the company listed in the Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China alone , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , shipments bag@@ ged almost a sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann carried out the weaker figures from July , especially on two selling days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some key markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has given rise to sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on exit from the EU was also bur@@ dened by a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the emission standard first escal@@ ated , a minus is also recorded .
the Chinese market is a big support for VW .
overall , the primarily affected house brand of Lower Saxony is further deterior@@ ated by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only one delivery minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to forward a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had been using a software to manipul@@ ate exhaust gas tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the course of the upgrade , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars had no negative impact .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer provides customers with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but not from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as stated on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of re@@ engineered diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of In@@ qu@@ iry and of the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; said German Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that if fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take place after retro@@ fitting , all typical vehicle values have remained unchanged .
Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; warranty &quot; but not as it was in business circles .
with the wide term &quot; Guarant@@ ee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , six months after the conversion , customers can come to a workshop for half a year - and this could be traced back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interests of customers , it is important to avoid that , in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal , it is necessary to ins@@ ure as to possible warranty regulations as it was called .
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future criminal interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German B@@ anks Association speaks of an individual case and does not consider it a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent penalty interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee applies to Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits exceeding € 100,000 on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been taking care of 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are at me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , he is now paying the costs further .
leaving the cash simply in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank &apos;s counter would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank manager .
most customers would have an understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course is causing significant costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you alone bear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with penalty interest for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide charges for deposits , and competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele , which is more luxuri@@ antly equipped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooperative bank , founded in 1911 , has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no further banks are currently known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany won &apos;t like this in the l@@ ati@@ tude .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged s@@ labs .
before you rush to the comment section , to s@@ nat@@ ch it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ man@@ ence men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght for@@ esi@@ ght between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it &apos;s also not a hor@@ den by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ o@@ v ?
if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and pitch wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something more intimate like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there &apos;s still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand close to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I wrote of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 boards .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , rev@@ ise the walls of his living room .
the reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably thought was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the you@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about their com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people generally have to get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 .
customers who used to sell their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of followers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like F@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing sense of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older clients were offen@@ ded by the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar album sleeves , from objects that wake up happy memories of rejo@@ icing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector so I think it &apos;s the case with many people .
it is a simple way to work spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a record st@@ acks fl@@ ush@@ es out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month haven &apos;t heard them yet .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while looking through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came here only recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead LP so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ proof , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , dedicated to the sound panels almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ t@@ enth@@ ter pop , instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ens out of the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks particularly lonely , but obvious psychological trauma is hard to det@@ ecting when standing next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records for sale .
it makes rather a shop window than a big shopping .
it does not deserve much , therefore collecting sheets is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives away with a de@@ ar@@ ate si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression to mu@@ stering jeans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks at them - maybe because they are just decorative , some so far up that it &apos;s impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that gives most for luxury items such as records .
even if my research showed that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female colle@@ cti@@ bles that exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .

French court re@@ jects proposal on deals with deals in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods from cigar@@ ettes to final drinks , sell hair services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups informed the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ backed feder@@ ations and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also pointed out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than merely to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is communal servi@@ ce@@ . 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimates on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .

he must analyze in silence what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will examine everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

watching other people watching video games is a huge escape - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am speci@@ alizing in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started off with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can abandon the players &quot; missions and oppose enemies , as well as provide equipment .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash@@ es are tested , which should super@@ v@@ ise tem@@ pos@@ als very effectively .
the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler by Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is maintained with a stationary bl@@ itter .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps five days in continuous measurement operation , the fall data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
laser measuring technology can also detect all vehicles across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limit@@ ers as well as drive @-@ through prohibited by time , stri@@ pe and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be equipped with each car with trailer hit@@ ch , according to the manufacturer .
in order to not simply steal it , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and , by the way , also disappear in a sh@@ ing@@ y outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also being used .
foreign authorities are also flash@@ ing with the new technique : recently , France has re @-@ ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
the impressive performance of Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by in the final on Thursday evening ended at an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ up , line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten up a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan , she lost every game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and had fun jumping from the attacks of G@@ Bs .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving coaches . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ward in the corner .
after four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a h@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mount of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third gate , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute there was a touch down in the right corner and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ides by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the transformation took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
that is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through Fi@@ ji after a brilliant inter@@ play .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an experiment for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ at sul@@ tan , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and danced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame took the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked in the grass .
earlier that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain crowded South Africa in a short semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight against the cancer of the trainer for a rowing win
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal@@ red gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve who go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ad in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport , who set such a standard .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ 000 un@@ paid employment , which is also un@@ exam@@ pled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in the rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that makes the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and that was what they did .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts passed to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ stirring morning talking about something more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . it may be a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no @-@ one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very well at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; remain in the process , remain in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion .
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe Wasser@@ expe@@ dient , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility company as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was in the original sound of a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the Water Forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group applies to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who has been a member of the association for 31 years , 28 of them as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ schla@@ cht , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply agreements for other towns and villages .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller worked as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Con@@ federation in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , sale of land in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and there has always been innovations again , because water is polluted and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ dati@@ o she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart @-@ blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the concept of success of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for the reduction of nit@@ rate in front of the Water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ front and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view he described the well structure and the restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were , however , the rup@@ ture of the pipe at the elevated tank near Kirch@@ hoff on January 3 .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of new brunn only because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shoots up to life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45@@ am in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and wounded them fat@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called upon us and stated to have shot his girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly re@@ punished .
in the meantime , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brow@@ ned and has a bald head .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a bal@@ dness .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
whoever sees Sven S. shall call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide any information on the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Light view for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed at additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens arising from the renewable energy industry are from the table .
the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to the cash register .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG turnover of 20 percent will fail .
but even this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts in the steel industry have a special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of our campaign &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to intensi@@ fy when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import steel show effect , on the other hand , the economic outlook in China is rising .
it is unclear how long @-@ term the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp recently did not want to exclude any closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced about six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Unit announced on Friday .
after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity manufactured went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an increase in orders in the coming months , thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Leh@@ rach @-@ studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior citizens choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and altogether more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
regular interaction enables sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaking up and organizing herself to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this reason , sen@@ iors train deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life as well .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia people are inv@@ inci@@ ble on long @-@ standing events .
in singing , a special performance is required to the head , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
even the elderly , who live alone , do not only practice to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who &apos;s listening to it when there &apos;s a tone next to it ?
in search of the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior &apos;s choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many senior male choirs can also be found on the Internet .
those who do not have access to the internet can ask family , friends or neighbours for help with internet research .
if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , recommends H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males at scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover the effect of calling k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ sty also did not leave the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al level of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ sting of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to caus@@ tic caus@@ ers , which are in great need , as scientists have found out by the Veter@@ inary Institute and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said about the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cries differenti@@ ates with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female cats from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H were observed .
they were played for a herd of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens which were lifted up in addition .
despite the small sample , researchers keep their results in a meaningful way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they swi@@ vel faster to the loudspeaker when this calls were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop@@ es with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males at all responded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ ologist said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds in humans .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver has issued an arrest warrant against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey an important football game takes place .
before the Du@@ eling of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the exception of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government asser@@ ted that normal citizens should not be affected .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
football won &apos;t stop there , too .
against the former heavy i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
accordingly , Sü@@ me@@ r , living in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is bl@@ amed by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup attempt .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days still applies until October , in fact it does not have any impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and enemies of Erdo@@ gan .
the fans of the Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experience in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at cup winner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will especially arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved his sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master had a conci@@ li@@ atory degree .
after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; bid farewell to the Europa League .
in the South Bank Li@@ g there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th Tit@@ le with 26 season buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ey @-@ King .
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez only borrow@@ ed from the AC Florence treaty after the coup attempt was announced after the coup attempt not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Princip@@ al Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als at Olympic Games in Rio
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin , 34 , had already been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to run in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian float in Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had lam@@ ented her starting right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was bl@@ am@@ eless and fl@@ ush@@ ed out at her start ( 100 metres of chest ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a super@@ posed smile she was still standing in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
when he found out that she was not going to catch the gold , the audience broke into a rush of applause .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start at the Rio Olympics despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was locked twice for dop@@ ing twice ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than ever , he is the number one in the world in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit off a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after the use of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don was detected .
after an operation she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion , was positively tested for the forbidden stimulus agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400@@ m / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and twice world champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement had been responsible , mut@@ ated mer@@ it .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world to date over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ sti@@ el , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly an athlete has subsequently recognized so many med@@ als .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give up Olympic silver 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championships for testosterone abuse .
he also received the recognised bronze medal for the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Tribunal in CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record woman and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was only tested positive in May , but still allowed to start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to the ing@@ es@@ tion of a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mild and went off on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital but had already left the hospital .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on , Austrian citizens are also still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so mu@@ le .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife .
according to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sions went up again , another man was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported in the morning by Ph@@ u@@ ket .
a taxi driver was injured when det@@ on@@ ation close to the popular beach beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular for tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban worker .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coast police .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ i K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but it is likely that these are the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were put by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police showed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings , airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs advises on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will not be any necessary trips to these provinces .
increased security risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos while the country strug@@ gled towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power after a period of bloody un@@ rest in 2014 , re@@ ass@@ ures itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several state offices , the constitu@@ ents of the Con@@ federation have also put the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see references to the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are being mi@@ stre@@ ated in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is opposed to &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; identified movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak to them with a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ties of Islam are just as legal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there had been reports on contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not understand . &quot; &quot;
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the constitutional protection at a certain point .
it depends on whether the party - in this case - the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not apparent .
with a view to the significant increase of legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism in this context .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fre@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are forming attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism , however , is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects in case of attacks on asylum cases had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene .
so many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , for example , elected CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , but then radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Kirov@@ ets Hab@@ its Bec@@ omes In@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records will not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ rat at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight flo@@ ats from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , credit has subsequently become a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his course with a re@@ position of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why is the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participating in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start @-@ up law from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries better known .
since most sports@@ men run in a@@ edi@@ cs , just wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it is ready for the big race .
the first names quickly made the rounds .
some media referred to him as &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ hale . &quot;

the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a campaign event in Florida .
if there is nothing in the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the U.S. presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either work out , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .

within his party there was more and more resistance .
post enters the trade with electrical transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action .
the interest of other firms in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
soon , the Group intends to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters also on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a post @-@ speaker said on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be delivered to other companies .
post @-@ Managing Director Jürgen Ger@@ der had said there are always questions , such as craftsmen .
according to information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group intends to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly .
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric vehicles and make a complete change@@ over to the eco @-@ friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P management ki@@ cks off after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the responses came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K announced that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uns@@ af@@ e the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing branches of business and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the worldwide number five of the industry faces a new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P CEO plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ers has already been dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
as early as September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ j@@ inger , informed the company .
he should officially assume the function of a &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; until a successor to Hart@@ mann is found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a company spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention details .
it is still unclear who will be responsible for the market research company in the future .
in investor circles it was said on Friday that shareholders were most recently disappointed with the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced several years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the top of the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are still not visible after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , each stock@@ holder will at some point become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in the first half of the year , sales shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent to 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
the profit in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the company &apos;s un@@ matched value in the face of its difficult economic situation .
the good@@ will in the Consumer Experience business unit of EUR 139 million , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business segment , gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.@@ 2m .
the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
eight people were injured during an accident involving 43 sen@@ iors as passengers on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ Hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , the police reported .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel @-@ company from Eisen@@ ach , according to the information , had to ev@@ ade an accommo@@ dating truck , which partly drove on the counter @-@ rac@@ et@@ rack .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident on the state road 2 .
the last passengers were brought back by a regular bus to the town of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel agency .
the investig@@ ators called on the trucks and witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter wastewater amount to 2.@@ 10 euros as of 1 October 2016 for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Zul@@ u berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate measures for improvement are necessary .
after a high cost calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach confirmed that under@@ coverings for these wastewater facilities were depl@@ eted .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ effective manner .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ u berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period can be compensated .
Schmidt explained that there were relatively small facilities for all three wastewater facilities with a very low waste water fall , measuring between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
because of the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , in the past period of calculation , all three plants were not least due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expendi@@ tures in a considerable extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as the Zul@@ u mountain , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf .
in the pumping station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up . after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be depl@@ eted , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses came the continued support and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs for wastewater facilities in the past 20 years , has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the utility area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater utility association cannot be extended because it is a deficit .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as Asian cartoon was critici@@ zed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure made of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are unique , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million more sel@@ fies per day .
all ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm gets to the public .
in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused of promoting the application of black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it proposed a filter to some users this week , which gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice . &quot;
they wondered whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote in an e @-@ mail , whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and the least unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ resistant , but that the yellow face has been moved to the decreasing extreme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult that things go un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu also critic@@ ised the large part of white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company .
on Thursday , the company refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , on their part , said they had their Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership distor@@ ts IS@@ IS intelligence , determines Committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual conditions were allowed , an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Republi@@ can member of the Defence Committee , intelligence committees and military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret services analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence intelligence , typically dra@@ fted by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly drew a positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism as the real conditions were allowed on the spot and were consistently positive than analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the management errors in the Cent@@ com are up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed en@@ during problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government peaks have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already commen@@ ce in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command &apos;s leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called on the Task Force after being admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report released on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; the high @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was little room for differing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who were admitted to complaints by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesperson , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still ongoing .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alle@@ gation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of divisions more than ten years ago than a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , according to government officials , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ ker notes that contrary to government statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , reported the Times in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in Central Command .
the US won fourth match in the ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with UK is pending .
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group .
however the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey club in her hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the local area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then pulled in the middle and drew the ball into the goal for the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament to go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympics , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympics are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning rod , which is passed from the watch@@ strap to the tri@@ athlete by the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gym@@ n@@ ast .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the waiting line in the Coff@@ es@@ hop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with o@@ dd@@ les , could have been among those known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV commerci@@ als , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow there are sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping is an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it became so ten@@ ly noticed that many that I had questioned did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has some kind of out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than that for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and pi@@ geon , the two sports that it essentially unites .
the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; stems from the span@@ ish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot;
bud@@ ding winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are evaluated according to official Olympic program according to completion , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the goal , sometimes towards and back , upwards and down on the playground .
they don &apos;t just hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also in the TV transmission another hits the goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel as a little ti@@ ring even when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she jumps off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
here too , a competition prev@@ ails , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise , there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also around 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will bla@@ ze the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympic man@@ ia they promise a calm , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the spru@@ ce and the objective of male athletes - according to the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base , according to the Wall Street Journal .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses asser@@ t that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police at shot changes .
is Ethiopia currently breaking together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less , according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen killed and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation videos about the protests , probably from the last or earlier this year , show how security workers hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now calls for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Project Manager of the Horn of Africa , the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians in order to fight terrorist risks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive as much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy was expanding at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , where dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the vast expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely @-@ critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions escal@@ ate along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liberation Front , which were forced more or less in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves .
several factors explain why the feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of getting worse under the surface .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians told them that they gathered to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in the politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this , too , is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is usually dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , the secret services , commerce and politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was the Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on an un@@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special agents to treat opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively opa@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al was in 2005 after thousands of prot@@ esters prot@@ ested , apparently ple@@ dged by the government according to the statements of analysts and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and for their measur@@ able progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an town , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights across neighboring Somalia , although it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s claim that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication created new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who are trying to protect him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , in the peculiar position to explain the statements he had not meant at all .
after he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump left behind the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative radio present@@ er Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate would not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism le@@ aps down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has attempted to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to declining demand values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her talk d@@ ull .
Mr Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Natur@@ ally , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic barriers in politics and then to ruin them as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more cher@@ ished sound , since his survey values have gone further .
a recent survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a major lead over North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr Tr@@ ump tries to not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ interpreting his humour .
but while he is intensi@@ fying in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ zer has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Tr@@ umps , expressed great difficulty in defending the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comment@@ aries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ sli@@ ppers , completely false , and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by allowing the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats s@@ coff@@ ed at Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
once talked about the price of the market , Café returns to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the store So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excep@@ ted and club is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it is also re @-@ inv@@ enting .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do so , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural swe@@ ats .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly .
even after being pulled to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee drink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was on coffee and culture in the ver@@ b that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long@@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
indeed , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for tasting with the coffee of coffee from the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish residents , Green@@ points , also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he has prepared to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has other benefits .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was ruined on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
his menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published in Har@@ per &apos;s publishing house on Tuesday , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , car@@ eless snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the re@@ porter ordered wood roast , this found the couple suitable for discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were made of an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts to serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; marks the ways in which the country avoided being the land of Cock@@ a@@ ig@@ ne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e committed why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food that K@@ asser@@ ol@@ le could re@@ use as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ using food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ pal@@ atable ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat that was the focal point of American cuisine for years has become a rare luxury .
strange bl@@ ends have been tried out as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , a tile was prepared from that time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive for lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household business recipes .
as never before , or ever since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - appe@@ aled the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and to turn the challenge of transforming pamp@@ as such as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude , are pal@@ atable .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ aire man from the world he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt may have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to stamp an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt compla@@ ined that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with eating , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the land returned to the legs .
the legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave in writing the book the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better understood - for example how she could not throw up food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brick man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ break .
after having cleared the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roos@@ ev@@ elt was eating at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man and added that it was a common plo@@ y to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone was reluct@@ ant to take a spoon in the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E picked up three times a set@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on a Assad regime &apos;s barrel bomb attack .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group , who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game in order to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilians who showed him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans the lumin@@ ous symbol@@ ism in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has never seen himself as heroes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrels of barrel over the Alz@@ adi@@ a District , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the toxic rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Assad regime &apos;s deadly bomb had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ ral is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
born in 16@@ 24 , he swi@@ ms at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland ha@@ ie only get up to 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it really counts , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a rat 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
but this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate by a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
the evolution bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland will be stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers have little knowledge of the lifestyle of Greenland Sh@@ arks .
their slow motion was measured when they buried six animals with one transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , this sh@@ arks spoil the loo@@ t : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ a@@ vers coming from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland Sh@@ arks , who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest shar@@ k measured 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
to determine the age of the animals , the carbon @-@ 14 method analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l core .
their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons searched for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
on the other hand , with 220 centimet@@ res of the third @-@ smallest animal , the lens kernel contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapon tests , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had , on the other hand , normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in their lens @-@ core , that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers would be even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the increase obviously let itself at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon point , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declares the evolution@@ ist Sch@@ euer@@ eck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources rather in a long life .
building site in double pack
with topics relating to construction , the council has dealt a key role in the recent meeting .
with relief , the Board adopted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally , the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot;
after the land , plot and development issues have been clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ ve@@ ying have been clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ wal@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties .
the council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau will appeal to young families and other sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , the building volunteers can now announce themselves in the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September meeting .
in order to meet requests for the establishment of further business enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the council decided to change the land use plan that was newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ sections .
thus , in the Unter@@ war@@ lar@@ n area the designated industrial estate is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chance of attracting work@@ stations and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether money houses should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
for the so @-@ called EU passport , approval in the UK has so far been sufficient .
that &apos;s what big US banks use .
several banks have already announced that they will reloc@@ ate jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; calcul@@ ates with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities , such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk management .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg certainly beats a big fund industry , but also cuts bad in infrastructure like Dublin .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the town features readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the River Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxemburg at number 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
even though quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial center for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concludes .
but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my econom@@ ist .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt , there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of legal costs incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was exemp@@ t from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two Mer@@ ck patents related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of mer@@ cks , including the expression and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was collected on Thursday , US judge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the relief of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medication , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took charge of each other and took possession of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , following the extract of the still remaining groups of fighters that have been buried within the city , are currently comb@@ ating the city .
they have liberated over 2,000 civilians held ho@@ stages by the comb@@ at@@ ants , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared the Man@@ bi@@ j military council Reu@@ ters , who al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal tax
H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 on Friday , which gave the Democrats and their husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ars ; the former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns in the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; stated Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump conce@@ als behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ treats regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ pers Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Democrats .
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump consultant , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ ump critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business units and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday , promp@@ ting high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
in the election campaign , federal taxes have become an issue .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million paying a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has here his seat to exchange tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
Buff@@ ett said he had been subjected to a tax audit by the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump was &quot; afraid &quot; from the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has covered its tax return by 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the 2015 Clin@@ tons &apos; tax return showed that these only accounted for USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed by USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanzania &apos;s elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders .
the method has proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensified its funding along with U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World &apos;s Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe within these communities a change in their attitude , being much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants away from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps cover the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a pop and spra@@ yed fine dust of powder into the air .
a breath is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
one last possibility is a ver@@ fer shooting a Gol@@ dre@@ gen fire@@ works in the air and causing a loud , bright explosion .
town council decided unanim@@ ously : no new construction of Ki@@ os@@ k@@ neu@@ bau at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of industrial companies with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and assume - especially the retail sector in the core city is considered to be significantly exp@@ and@@ able .
the city council , however , now unanim@@ ously refused to apply for the new construction of a sale ski on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction .
&quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit any further , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction .
Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berliner Hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after an &quot; Arab &quot; prompt - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots released a media rebellion after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pres@@ election as Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary Sho@@ ah , expressed his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotels &apos; selection list .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
written by Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a way to choose Israel through its own call centre .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberate decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany , Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ ton called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were shocked and upset by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the Internet in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some instructed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reflect on the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed , &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble course of the Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue .
the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the country code has now been added .

the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police shooting rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on their plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ mine , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the temporary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest shown by Russian companies on businesses in the country increased strongly , the ambassador informed them .
Russian companies are taking up existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan dates from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian delegation represented around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily tourist vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year were broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the Ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
wanted to witness : drow@@ ning the beverage market in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y occurred on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the restra@@ int of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces demanded the publication of cash by the employee of the drink market and then fled initially on foot and then presumably with a silver colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible from the car park of the Re@@ we market and is clearly visible .
the perpetr@@ ators have to be scre@@ ened in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have fled from the gravel parking lot located opposite the car park entrance with the silver colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ ch@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations about the crime time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun during summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers at their summer holiday in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in quietly situated leisure theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ ovo , the joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , they went to B@@ rescue by visiting the zoo .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
at the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group rejo@@ iced at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and p@@ add@@ ling .
for culinary purposes , children and car@@ ers were treated with their self @-@ prepared food such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops it was created , beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game .
further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of their home trip , the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the young regi@@ stran@@ ts from the care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were accomplished .
in order to bridge the time to the next Roma pilgrimage of all the min@@ stran@@ ts presumably two years ago , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ te round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgri@@ ma@@ ges .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and one decided finally for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened portal of mercy on Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmer were on their way .
in the evening before , Father Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and told the Pil@@ gri@@ m blessings .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Min@@ ster Un@@ ser@@ er loved wife stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started .
each day and evening the individual day @-@ to @-@ day tours were accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is started to sing together a song from a specially crafted pilgri@@ m song to the field crosses , chap@@ els or churches .
parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the stage ends , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a delicious and hearty dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
day after , the stage came to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at weaker heat , some 500 metres altitude had to be desc@@ ended and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgri@@ m &apos;s day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg on the final stage .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t , which arrived on the pilgrimage destination , was welcomed at the evening fair in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storm home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scottish Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took up the pi@@ vot@@ al role his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London train world championships despite the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ fahr@@ er- Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that is now un@@ folding .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who prevailed four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner scored an Olympic ch@@ ord in qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ der was scar@@ ed , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner made it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear in order to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and , above all , Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der as they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
in the final round we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal by England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which was won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the bicycle .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos; victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a hi@@ ve of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint race , which will start today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two further gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record that won gold in London in 2012 was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where the focus will be on W@@ ig@@ gins .
he had cont@@ ested yesterday with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
in the corresponding Women &apos;s Competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong train cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a number of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary demonstration of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April was in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing repro@@ aches as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome it looks like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which at the perfect moment has reached its peak , could be repeated again .
future of Port@@ land mel@@ ding due to the elimination of energy demand
the future of aluminum mol@@ ten from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby canc@@ els all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to run the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is scheduled for November .
up to 2,000 work@@ stations in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry melt which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
Al@@ coa &apos;s melt in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the long @-@ standing speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means additional physical demand for electricity through the melting facility , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L also stated that the contracts were called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have come into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the pre@@ dictions of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; Exp@@ ec@@ ation of a Termin@@ ation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Sk@@ ill Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt would not be impaired .
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into force from November this year , even if there is still one explanation , why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the industry &apos;s bad economic situation prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land use around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of power per year and consume about 900 MW of electricity per year .
if both plants van@@ ish from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , cre@@ eping reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ ce ) .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ y act of almost every birth episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ ce brought the phrase &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with a view to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim might have beaten her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a volume resem@@ bling a fashion magazine more than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ star is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine filtered through before the official announcement .
women already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the mo@@ dest@@ y &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV history J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always a bit ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ os of the moment . &quot;
these feelings grew up again when the news came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but lying around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells photos of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen on Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centres reject 160@@ ,000 people per year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s relief operations are rejected by the community centres every year , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mi@@ tigation on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their quest for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the community centres of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey by the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without the suspension of the Federal Government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who have been released un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need of help from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the General Prosecutor and the Federal Court of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to lift these short@@ cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their community , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after employees allegedly drew gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump Camp@@ a@@ ign has been charged for alleged in@@ action after you have been told that their campaign manager for North Carolina has sent a fire@@ arm to an employee in February , while they travelled in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
B@@ ordin@@ i stated to have been waiting for months to regulate the matter internally before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ente Kni@@ zh@@ eh@@ le , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment .
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to harm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the charge comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina to take action when his Ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges were to be appointed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign made it clear that the media would have torn out its words from the context and that it would not con@@ sp@@ ire to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint demands damages from the campaign for violation of due diligence and of Philip due to bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press spokesperson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not to be reached for an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to contact Philip just as wrong .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .
on calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far conducted a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on European elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the pending elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) there are considerable losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CD@@ U .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute In@@ sa for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
but in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again .
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would rise to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
the Gre@@ ens are reluct@@ ant to return to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite the slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag respectively .
according to the survey , the SPD in Berlin had only 23 percent of the poll@@ s ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still paraly@@ zing the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but on the left hand , 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the Pir@@ ates would , on the contrary , miss the move in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched on the market .
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good at hand either .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would go for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution today .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occurred exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , in the stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age somehow .
twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer show in Hanover as an office in the west pocket format .
in fact , the new mobile phone could have a lot for that standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , albeit very slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could have gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and packaged to Microsoft .
today , suppliers dominate the market , all of which later came as Nokia .
being online always and everywhere is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this is due to the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has ar@@ isen around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced on Mac @-@ World the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry dominated the market .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of personnel at Siemens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as it was in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will already provide 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ per@@ ing on the world stage .
the doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked to him .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in social growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - which was chosen five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to provide a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ play &quot; for ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , attempts to avoid ad blocking are the same as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program in order to further block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the coding on its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that there was a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle is underway between the announ@@ cing open source community and the conver@@ ters since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators have become the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenue from Facebook .
the company refra@@ ined from targeting ads on desktop PCs because mobile ad blocking have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues so that Facebook is the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference tool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying , because they would block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control in people &apos;s hands .
woman suspected of suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning was on a highway in the early hours of the morning on a supposed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 in the proximity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman wanted to kill herself at the age of 49 , which was ski@@ pped by several vehicles , including a truck .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them , as well as any witnesses of the incident , to report to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure has been established , which is a &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared with the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said court ser@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases where a person walked in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of neg@@ ligent killing after having passed a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , who had responded to an emergency call -- drove to a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate lives and protected from faster evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary researchers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen with@@ drew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a small contribution to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
in the course of the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , which requires it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season , Roy has won the 2013 @-@ 14 A@@ val@@ an@@ ches Award as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league .
he took the club on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches awarded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike on strike
the labor disputes relating to wages for North Sea workers will be suspended , while all dispute parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several day @-@ to @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems anew .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
at the beginning of this week , Scottish MP Dave Anderson met workers leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest job disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why the stars in the star cluster rotate in different rates as well as in which context the rotation periods are associated with planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s infrared processing and analysis center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they turn the fastest now .
at peak rotation rates , these mature stars rep@@ el large quantities of star@@ vation .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is ageing , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star @-@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereby bigger stars rotate slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as the ideal Cos@@ mic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
it is still much more than we would like to learn more about how the How , When and Why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and , so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base @-@ Base .
after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 year old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es for the last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to both , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ star All @-@ Star Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
he signed a 10 @-@ year contract with 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and Yan@@ ke@@ es he has made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar figures .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eball .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so cont@@ ested is his appearance outside the place .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have taken forbidden ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance anti @-@ aging clinics in South Florida for years .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league might even have done me a favour for 2014 because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends hit the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to Di@@ az by act@@ ress Cameron and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , was symp@@ athetic to the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ ri@@ vals Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caught Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio due to a positive dop@@ ing test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a well @-@ trained athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official acts of dop@@ ing have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre barrier runner si@@ bl@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil - immediately prior to the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these news came to an end .
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Court of Sport ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing has been requested at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news le@@ aked over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive himself .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be a dietary supplement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic lady . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the banned substance is supposed to act as an EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ trial has already been positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately announced his criticism of the Bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday the case was known as &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny taking , however , both must not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the launch of the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad from the start , except for systematic dop@@ ing , and also the L@@ umin@@ ous nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous off@@ ences in China caused violent cl@@ ashes between the athletes .
so the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sun was also the focus of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun had been tested positively on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down for a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ presses h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som payment
black@@ mail program@@ mers are currently using targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by the malware protection specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims willingly pay the ran@@ som sal@@ aries demanded by the perpetr@@ ators , in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetr@@ ators , according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , speci@@ alize in attacks on corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially lead @-@ out ran@@ som is much higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programs were still designed to send adver@@ ts .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company att@@ els took place in the past months sho@@ cking fast .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files , such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the sh@@ in@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als in a sustained manner .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly , the damage is incurred if a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals already have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay are getting their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in view of down@@ time in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study investig@@ ators of F @-@ Secure examined the user areas and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay using Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files .
and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk profits from Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
it is more prob@@ able , however , that it is about three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software tool@@ box to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware @-@ kits were created by purchasing the malware , counsel@@ ing and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; the scope of supply includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then searches for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected machine .
&quot; usually the criminals then deleg@@ ate Sp@@ ammer to spreading , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of respon@@ dents in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful registration , the offen@@ ders are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
thus , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take up completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Def@@ con ch@@ opping conference , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then instead of the heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear .
the interior materials are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is down there .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box .
there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l when the back rests are folded , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the 650 mm boost height is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should do his job a little qui@@ eter though .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another version of the engine : a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top variant leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the city emergency braking assistant ( working at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to the recognition of traffic signs and throt@@ tles the speed when required .
but full connectivity is available only for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation system , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol station from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : top@@ pling on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ) of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is only possible in the case of hazards that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a cre@@ ase in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
disease case : when does the organizer pay
after their trip , sick leave only get money back if the cause of the disease is to be found in the hotel without any doubt .
however , this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the case , a family had to suffer from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of her ur@@ ination .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the tourists back to a defective sewage treatment plant that was said to have polluted the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was so lacking - and compla@@ ined against the promot@@ er .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the promot@@ er experienced only shortly before the departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duties of information , so the verdict .
especially since in the samples of water there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly due to con@@ ta@@ gion to one another - is a general risk of life .
there were only 38 guests from 6@@ 91 guests .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be dispos@@ ed of and determined at the same time to acts of terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and split . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t afford this triumph to terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if criminal offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , this would increase security and also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a realization of the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another recruitment of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ fourth scale order for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
video surveillance should be improved , the right to arms can be am@@ ended , making it more difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the danger of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with a look at psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers better social care .
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special fields of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear candy for the char@@ gers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abolition of double citizenship previously .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be constitu@@ tionally problemati@@ cal .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
green @-@ boss Sim@@ one Peter designed the minister to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist acts of action and ability to act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet S@@ prü@@ che and a tightening of the right to stay put the people in this country no longer safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway network
it st@@ alls regularly on the ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the legal department store should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic every evening in traffic on the surrounding street , when they drive over the highway in Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th August ) , road construction will extend in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ er Straße in the direction of the right @-@ hand bend of 700 metres .
drivers can then thread directly from Hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is spread in the early stages , thereby improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the return journey goes up to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ a way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason for this is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 just before the Wes@@ er Straße exit .
from here , the traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back more than three @-@ four@@ ths ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge could no longer have the required load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy load traffic in two lanes .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated plant @-@ daily traffic jam will last will not be able to tell the competent regional operation .
however , with years to expect : the bridge has an official remaining period of time until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal treatment course , the state company deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays because there is a disability to be reck@@ oned with .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre Association are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Forest School Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ visible House &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster .
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the staging at the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the framework of this project .
most of the young people in the class had come to Münster , Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , so the news release of the Young Theatre Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Germany , and the Young Theatre will work together as part of a musical theatre project in the coming season .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background should be able to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical speech mediation are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for a better weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern a line in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was poorly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectac@@ les , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night of Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are among the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
rest@@ ful night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night one lies awake for hours , in the morning is already far ahead of the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing no longer think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are various causes underlying them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and S@@ leep Medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ation and sleep@@ iness .
it is precisely the sleep that many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of directors of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently is the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common especially in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , you can wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to a doctor with sleeping disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , tell the jury .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , ind@@ eli@@ ble , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - as treatment options .
Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is hardly available in Germany .
for this reason , you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with your sleep .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for an examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise for example snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of sickness , sleep@@ walking or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown distur@@ b@@ ance , says Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes in the body , one carries a nose glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping person .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep .
it also counts : regular sleep and rising times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleep , avoid drinking alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to count immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ zer has sold himself to Olymp@@ is via Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cut off of the DS@@ V team .
he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a in December 2014 and at the same time set his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ zer has been protecting himself against his ex @-@ team@@ mates who prot@@ ested in the criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle king of € 150@@ ,000 no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page during the night .
the conveying system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not look closely at dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ zer had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A for a certain period of time must not participate , &quot; says the election @-@ Hamburger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop .
airport : bound by baggage di@@ ver arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 .
as a band , the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf Airport became a band known to the police officers from past acts of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences this year since the middle of July and have proc@@ eeded jointly , in division , and especially professionally .
the specialists of the criminal com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can prove four actions to the Di@@ eves , who had travelled to Germany to commission criminal off@@ ences .
in total , they had caught up to more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between a rem@@ nant of cob@@ ble@@ stone streets : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t seem like this at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one passes the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , it will be built : a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , are preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly the interior sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken out several times for a tough action by the police against the project , called the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ets , were cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police for three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the spot , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
at the same time , building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evi@@ ction had been illegal , and one day later the police and construction workers removed from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk vor@@ m late .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is attracted by three children here , are mostly of the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from the van@@ ishing left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police open between occup@@ iers and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in East Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today has a lower average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses in the former G@@ DR were occupied , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was cleared under large police forces in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and election @-@ makers from all over the world : with them local residents from the G@@ DR times and former occup@@ ants share their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the ri@@ gs are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on raised windows or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with colored bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences such as physical assault are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make material damages , which tend more to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no question of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for acts of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together in the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
this is why it was so important for her to get back her road : from the police , the politics and the media , who in July all suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former gaps that the old inhabitants are displac@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well @-@ equipped are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot really appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ iled people who are angry about colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who is moving into a pub , compla@@ ining badly about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be called with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is mixed .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer of the working group indicated that the honorary officials are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now here , the yo@@ d@@ elling wool mil@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem .
this meant that some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long experience in the field of social work , an egg @-@ based wool mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been with us for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position on a three @-@ year term .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players .
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers soon stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the cost of the building , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it has not been possible to rely on private apartments , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be not@@ orious as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do not char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive external impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and , above all , language courses .
professional courses are rare .
thus , administration and community of volunteers also jump here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
anyone who develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help nobody in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be un@@ profitable , he will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are also problem cases , says the customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing is at all . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always also to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization after the latest occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some nai@@ ve may call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents should also be addressed by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would completely dis@@ credit them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary official must look for activities in the region and in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have always been in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
the policy is not afraid to answer this question .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet reached where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach has already been utilized to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently about 100 people , predominantly young men .
but if people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar with helicopter wanted
the police helicopter flew in different areas for about an hour - un@@ successfully .
two unknown men are forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.@@ m .
the villa@@ gers surprised the two and struck the bar@@ b@@ arians to flee .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters in size , probably mas@@ ked , carried both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies .
they fled towards the city centre .
the police deployed several stri@@ pe crew as well as a police helicopter .
the search went without success .
perhaps the unknown fell in front of the apartment or at their escape .
