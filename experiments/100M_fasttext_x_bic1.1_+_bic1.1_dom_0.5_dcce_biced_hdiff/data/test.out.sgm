<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variety with a ride on the beach with some colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramids of sport" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted home at the fast gallop to the feed-consoles.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this speed, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And with that the riding career then ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was led with his family about the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even hover for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen at a small gala the Golden Sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable sportsman does not lack any distinctions.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silberne laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already rebuked him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "" "" "says Langer," "" "" "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting young talents.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US champion was added to the Hall of Fame of the German Sports on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Among the drawn signs are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the real Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-rider Meinhard Nehmer, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum of the handball Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company went to the Springstedion, where the Lavazza Award went.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump economic policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - we want Clinton as well as Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Der, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "trump refuses to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claimed Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will drive up regulations substantially, and he is committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Clinton says, on the other hand," "" "" "" "The state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has privileged opportunities to open up and needs money for it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "therefore, the taxes on the rich would increase," "" "" "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the case of investment, Trump and Clinton say almost wordless.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicant announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are being strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">In other words, some internal discussions could be made on trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and refuel coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly strengthen and demand renewable energies with their investment program: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, do not want to sign either.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump is standing who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to ask the rich, is asking them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing themselves, almost everyday.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house has a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised lodgings for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="25">In their home they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor morals, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>

<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rarity," "" "" "" "says Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Anyone who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, misses, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, all standing women in refugee shelters are often regarded as inferior and at worst abused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 percent of women who live in the apartment in the north of Munich are traumatized.</seg>

<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">Some with no answer to the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing as government accommodations in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="40">Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government, says that even in Swabia alone, fled women are not accommodated separately.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are floors or houses in some common buildings only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant doctors have called on their union to approve new combat actions in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) demanded its entire Council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that it would have been appointed ministers to respond to the concerns about the contract.</seg>

<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in favour of the elections.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "" "" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "" "" "an alliance of outsiders" "" "" "" "?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">Leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin welcomes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed narrowly ribbed and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan had behaved as if there was never anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's emblazing, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downfall of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was skyrocketed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into Russia's back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the cousins is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved in a failed coup d "état last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late season onslaught at the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this week, the state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports were allowed again." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemsti put it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, as its reaction to the attempted takeover of power is considered a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the sustained resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is piqued, is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relations with the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit meeting in this prestigious palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to demonstrate how it once seemed to me an analyst to depict "an alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel offbeat and badly treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents expressed themselves at the press conference that they wouldn't even have stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state should at least speak together again.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.</seg>
<seg id="4">Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was connected to the Bank's global ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Bank has since distanced itself since it had to be collapsed and rescued eight years ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this period, brand strategists "RBS" have used to protect other end-consumer brands.</seg>
<seg id="7">She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from the Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>
<seg id="8">But now it has decided to focus more national brands.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.</seg>
<seg id="10">In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the listing on stock exchange are to be changed to NatWest.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are other smaller brands for private client business that are getting more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.</seg>
<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">He shared the BBC Scotland with: "the brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand where our employees will be engaged, as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."</seg>
<seg id="15">When the Bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local targets." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that its six Nations sponsorship will no longer carry on and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we focus on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chairman of the Executive Board.</seg>
<seg id="20">It would have been cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands.</seg>
<seg id="21">But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, one will see many changes.</seg>
<seg id="22">We can launch these trademarks again, so I think the time has come.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the strictest confidence circle of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed a Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that without stating reasons," "" "" "" "the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who had been his deputy since 2012, was named as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website, it reads (in Russian) that he later was the Chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activities as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was long time one of the closest confidante Vladimir Putin and works as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So, is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who once was praised as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said: "it is true that I asked you to talk to me at the beginning of 2012, this very complicated post - you could almost say - trusting posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV assumed the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that according to Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term would violate Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another late Putin's ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "" "" "deck blower" "" "" "", "which approach each of the three towers of the bridge." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said:" "" "" "" "this is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensferry crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate operation that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the deck's deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high and low construction.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the extension of the North Tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern spreading bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive yet very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate, because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="7">So far a regulation is missing.</seg>

<seg id="16">Despite this, viola, a tightening of the situation in the housing market has vanished.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their spare time on staring on screens has been plastered by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that the technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later on a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand decreased in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (using a screenshot on the cell phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game led to a considerable rise in increments that the "average" person puts back each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, recently announced the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of follow-up people who train 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes" to get "from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and come from people looking miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who exercise regularly can reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also irregularities that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could go against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will fade away with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, based on poker's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, more active, and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortlessly on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliantly brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also Olympic Champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast clapped to the championship title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly in front of the silver medallists and "Final Five" teammates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Women Simone Biles sculpts on the balance beam during the single multi-fight event of women in the artistic gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a championship title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey in that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected her last exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American Women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-fight arena of women during the Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Billy insisted on having never planned the future during their long journey to the top, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical tumbling pass - is attuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainee Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition for a competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa was slightly led by two turns, the picture was cloudy.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hovering beams and floor plans - in which Biles holds the world title - was lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She returned with 15,433 on the hovering beam again - and with a 15,933 on the floor he sat on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her death - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Billy brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafa in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called Oma, had a head start.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground exercise she was cast down by the crowd, overwhelmed by a comeback, which at times seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, said the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm, while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, is to be read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police announced that the triple murder did not appear to be the result of a robbery, since the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks and two more were injured in hispanic residential areas within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it happens in a residential area in front of a house," "" "" "" "told Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report about the shooting that dumped on an empty truck half an hour before the triple murder and it is assumed that it was the serial killer's work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I put forward under the Women's Olympics in the Turning and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who had an inspiring effect for many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the United States.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female gymnast was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic medalist and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of the threefold world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful scary routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so do gymnastics in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to take part in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympiad will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turnen is a costlier sport and gymnasts primarily in private gymnastic societies which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sneakers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts maintain their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started doing gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer the municipalities aun countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-reach turnout training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnast of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we offer free and affordable walking in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic clubteam and thanks for motivating her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors want to organise more strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37.000 assistance doctors who voted on a vote refused.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be found in a "No Man's Land" and that any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance doctors are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the nursing care.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairwoman of the BMA committee for assistance doctors said last night in a communication with: "assistance physicians have still raised serious concerns to the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and deliver it to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts made by the BMA to resolve disputes through discussions caused the government to participate and sometimes on a deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just done last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise awareness and address the worries of assistance doctors." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">If he fails to do so, the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work-fighting measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a respite of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and doctors were involved to cover doctors on the strip chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed agreement with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekendpoint for the 54,000 assistants who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, general director of the NHS employees, called on the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "work-fighting measures achieve nothing of the only little, but strain already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare for patients, carers and their families only worry, need and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months we have spoken to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblower with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from professional training, training knots, mutual recognition of curriculum, continuing education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA agreements in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year, and a quarter of these suffer another heart attack or stroke.</seg>

<seg id="11">People who have had a heart attack are at a higher risk to have another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is marketed under the brilique trade name, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The design of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12-month consumption of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have a heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a provisional recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for a government report on corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a culture of political Correctness has led to ignoring widespread election scams in Muslim communities as a crushing government report today revealed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of "hypersensitivity concerning ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an antagonist king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut-off bands outside of electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should lead an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at present, a voter must mention his name and address." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person's finger when they release their votes to prevent someone to vote twice.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a consequence of Tower Hamlets Choice Award in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Luton Rahman, was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.</seg>

<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm regarding the fraudulent postal voting - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the conduct of IDs to prove their identity</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "in his report it is said:" "" "" "" "as proof it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, in particular women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elders, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background."

<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were concerns that... State institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "hypersensitivity concerning ethnicity and religion." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists to process postal voting documents to stop "harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also demands tougher registration checks to prevent the election listings being used for immigration and social security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing to check your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as it has left its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>

<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "prohibition of political activists to process full postal voting and envelopes from postal voting." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up shut-off for election stations.</seg>

<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees generally enforce that voters go on their own in the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls across the Metropolitan Police and finds it "astonishing" that after the Tower Hamlet's case no criminal complaint has been made.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the electoral court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy to be unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high demands of the criminal proceedings.</seg>

<seg id="5">Macdonald, who had been taken on board in the CBS commentary team to give more "colour," could be heard: "this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, Baby."</seg>
<seg id="6">Too excited, as he claimed, he died like a pig.</seg>
<seg id="7">Thank you for this.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Chinese float in Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the floating relay 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, making it possible for Canadians to close the gap to China.</seg>
<seg id="9">Spectators throughout Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language.</seg>
<seg id="10">Emmett Macfarlane tweets, "Does the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig?????</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "the idiot has not captured that they were still on stream." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows: "this little 14-year-old Chinesin has lost the connection, Baby."</seg>
<seg id="13">The criticism against Byron Macdonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, at which he made many speeches.</seg>
<seg id="14">Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron Macdonald was</seg>
<seg id="15">Another Twitter user in Sarah Paradis wrote: "wow, # Byron Macdonald.</seg>
<seg id="16">You represent the CBC and Canada and let's look like racists. # was disgusted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly after, Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment and said: "we apologize for the comment on a swimming performance."</seg>

<seg id="20">The commentator colleague Scott Russel had to apologize in the name of Macdonald</seg>
<seg id="21">CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users complaining about Macdonald's comments</seg>
<seg id="22">The network also quickly apologized and released a message.</seg>

<seg id="25">To clarify one, Byron's comments referred to the performance of the swimmers and not on them as a person.</seg>
<seg id="26">Yet they were inappropriate and an unfortunate formulation. Byron does what he said, very sorry.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal assault.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn your predator around the skewer.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "if you approach you from behind, then you should turn out first, so that you can see your attacker and" "" "" "" "move out of the gun" "" "" "", "says Mizrachi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with his knee in the lath and twist while the attacker clashes with pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they align the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line, grab the weapon and rotate it so that the Attacker doesn't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler subjected his immune system and thausage to a serious test by leveraging some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abdicated his course on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before completing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to lick off the rinsing button of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left out what he nodded, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds at stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task put its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial underscore showed a luminary number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminescent number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick off after their luminescent number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here, because here it is disgusting.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the development of gut bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we conducted mad brainstorming that ended up saying" "" "" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had directed him, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others, with whom this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of respondents reported lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delogization with a damage of £50,000 because it terrorised their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skelby and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, the property owners shocked the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls were gaping holes, wooden planks were torn, rubbish was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, disputes and curses included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelby, 47, whose name stood on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden boards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly phoned the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing led her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiment was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their life was made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "one said," "" "" "" "They didn't care for anybody." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will become beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, stated that it would have been given the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the community house.</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant detested to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, as a delogization is always the last step into consideration in Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to clean out garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skelby received a fine after having found himself guilty of owning a drug of class B in trade-intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skelby, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple of lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">Accompanied by a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and met with the role of Maria a youth room.</seg>
<seg id="6">The orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he heats.</seg>

<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers Tony's love with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>

<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli is back with the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his gaze, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudice and fanaticism."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia shall not vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the Parliament's election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As stupid as yet it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the locals, who are to be persuaded by the election fighters, are on vacation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not indigenous, so don't choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are some practical problems: helpers, posters hang up, inflatable balloons and flyers out flyers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until the 4th of September, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to make election campaigns just over the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can tell it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in polls clear behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionality.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one can see from his large posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, Seering received cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the waning of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "your refugee policy, you" "" "" "" "We create" "" "" "" "has speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already seen how it is to make election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel federal election circuit is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target audience did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to Angela Merkel from other corners of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU largely renounces the usual campaign standings at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union also noted that in the country you are crumbling the basis that it must be very demanding to find a wire to the people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It goes like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his comrades is also self-exposing: "they must go where it hurts, namely, where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Social Democrats lagged behind partner CDU (25) and only marginally ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD had already won clearly with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into parliament." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of holiday necessity and transfer their election campaign largely to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "online campaign" "" "" "", "she calls the president of the country Claudia Müller." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">In other words, green campaigners go on search for traces of local voters under the vacationers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curls with a houseboat through the lakes of Mecklenburg and still finds it beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in Oftersingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg continued, the traffic situation in the place was relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Oftersingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive movement through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were partly significant complaints," said Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King responsible for the project management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and rather familiar with their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas become frantic.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increasingly called for the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there have been considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself very knowledgeable on the spot.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For businesspeople at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages arising from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>

<seg id="16">Overall, the primarily affected house brand of Lower Saxony is further deteriorated by the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only one delivery minus of 0.9 percent is to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, worldwide 5,904 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been using a software to manipulate exhaust gas tests.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of the upgrade, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars had no negative impact.</seg>
<seg id="22">After retrofitting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.</seg>

<seg id="29">"deviations from this are not accepted," said German Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry.</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has taken over the guarantee that if fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance do not take place after retrofitting, all typical vehicle values have remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen itself does not use the term "warranty" but not as it was in business circles.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "Guarantee," Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example, six months after the conversion, customers can come to a workshop for half a year - and this could be traced back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even in the interests of customers, it is important to avoid that, in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust scandal, it is necessary to insure as to possible warranty regulations as it was called.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, VW does not use the term "warranty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged slabs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section, to snatch it under the pseudonym Non-Allemanence men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Yougov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight foresight between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's also not a horden by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers tend to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of Youov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and pitch wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something more intimate like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there's still a handful of fantastic record specialist stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand close to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mood by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I wrote of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), revise the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and bought again items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably thought was too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets can apply to the youGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about their comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people generally have to get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who used to sell their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their CDs again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Fonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing sense of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older clients were offended by the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar album sleeves, from objects that wake up happy memories of rejoicing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a sort of consolation," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector so I think it's the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to work spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "a staff of a record stacks flushes out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month haven't heard them yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while looking through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said:" I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead LP so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-proof, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say:" "" "" "" "I have no record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, dedicated to the sound panels almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who take photos, teenage and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's newest synthesize and sextenthter pop, instead of experimental jazz drens out of the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks particularly lonely, but obvious psychological trauma is hard to detecting when standing next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running in business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes rather a shop window than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore collecting sheets is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives away with a dearate sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression to mustering jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at them - maybe because they are just decorative, some so far up that it's impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "" "" "it is pure" "" "" "" "plate art" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that gives most for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even if my research showed that the results of Yougov vote, they leave, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectibles that exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't want to spend their Thursday morning with the strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets through panels, while they steer clear of the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who runs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods from cigarettes to final drinks, sell hair services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which pose a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the Court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed federations and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also pointed out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable. "</seg>

<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer by Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at areas of accident, where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at 7-er Rugby in the final on Thursday evening ended at an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji distributed a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-up, line and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten up a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - that at least a brite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan, she lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and had fun jumping from the attacks of GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run into driving coaches. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, as Osea Kolinisau froward in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">After four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A hackle of Mitchell stopped the mount of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third gate, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute there was a touch down in the right corner and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still more than a minute of playing time... in the first half." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presides by further weak Tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The transformation took a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova ran through Fiji after a brilliant interplay.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an experiment for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Seat sultan, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame took the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight against the cancer of the trainer for a rowing win</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinalred gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 hard hieve who go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympiad in the second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport, who set such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39.000 unpaid employment, which is also unexampled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes, gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is operable and that was what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory their first thoughts passed to Williams, who spent a nerve-stirring morning talking about something more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. it may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it only repeats how much I and Helen and Robin have worked for." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin, we would be no-one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very well at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "remain in the process, remain in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exemplary for clarity for 31 years</seg>
<seg id="2">The managing director of the Veitensteingruppe Wasserexpedient, Ruppert Göller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "the association is considered" "" "" "" "exemplary" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water utility company as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago, it was in the original sound of a contribution of the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the Water Forum of the government of Lower Franconia praised the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the work of the Veitenstein Group applies to" "" "" "" "Bavaria far as exemplary." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who has been a member of the association for 31 years, 28 of them as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-purpose association of the Veitensteingruppe with its headquarters in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchschlacht, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply agreements for other towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller worked as a water attendant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Confederation in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they stretched from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency interventions on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), sale of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the high containers (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the renovations of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and there has always been innovations again, because water is polluted and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her Laudatio she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has worked with a lot of heart-blood for his water-purpose association and he has literally lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the concept of success of the Veitenstein Group for the reduction of nitrate in front of the Water Forum of the Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterfront and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view he described the well structure and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were, however, the rupture of the pipe at the elevated tank near Kirchhoff on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of new brunn only because one filled the elevated tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Light view for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared at additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens arising from the renewable energy industry are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German steel industry, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to the cash register.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG turnover of 20 percent will fail.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts in the steel industry have a special significance.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in terms of the reform of emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "" "" "" "explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and substantial price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to intensify when the world's largest producer of producers threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weak domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel show effect, on the other hand, the economic outlook in China is rising.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how long-term the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp recently did not want to exclude any closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced about six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Business Unit announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief upliftment in May, the quantity manufactured went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects an increase in orders in the coming months, thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehrach-studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior citizens choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and altogether more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, writes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular interaction enables seniors to socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "" "" "speaking up and organizing herself to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this reason, seniors train deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the puff in everyday life as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on older people, singing often has a very special effect," "" "" "" "says Ursula Lenz from the German Association of Senior Citizens" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia people are invincible on long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required to the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even the elderly, who live alone, do not only practice to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who's listening to it when there's a tone next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior's choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior male choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the internet can ask family, friends or neighbours for help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, recommends Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for every age.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Several dead</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital but had already left the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, Austrian citizens are also still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, so mule.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosions went up again, another man was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported in the morning by Phuket.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured when detonation close to the popular beach beach of Patong, which was popular for tourists.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded which killed an urban worker.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the precinct of the coast police.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin," "" "" "" "said it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same signature," said army general Dani Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but it is likely that these are the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were put by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities would have kept secret evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they had not been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police showed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but mostly they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">Following the well-known bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs advises on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will not be any necessary trips to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to instigate chaos while the country struggled towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, who had seized power after a period of bloody unrest in 2014, reassures itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">In the conflict, more than 6500 people have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="13">This is not a futile advertisement for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Last but not least, there had been reports on contacts of the "identities" to AfD politicians from several federal states.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "he did not understand." "</seg>
<seg id="19">Possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the constitutional protection at a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the party - in this case - the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, changes its direction and becomes extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not apparent.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the significant increase of legitimate criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maate said he would not speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have noticed in recent years that there can be right-terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Fretal Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or small groups are forming attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">But a nationwide or pan-European control of right-wing terrorism, however, is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">He expressed concern that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects in case of attacks on asylum cases had previously not been known as criminals, politically motivated offences or supporters of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">So many people have committed crimes that had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who might have been politically indifferent, for example, elected CDU, SPD or leftists, but then radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist sentiments. "</seg>

<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habrat at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight floats from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV images.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic meter wastewater amount to 2.10 euros as of 1 October 2016 for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3,44 instead of 2.10 Euro; for Zulu berg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate measures for improvement are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a high cost calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kulmbach confirmed that undercoverings for these wastewater facilities were depleted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zulu berg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt showed the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period can be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that there were relatively small facilities for all three wastewater facilities with a very low waste water fall, measuring between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Because of the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past period of calculation, all three plants were not least due to their age refurbishment and repair expenditures in a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as the Zulu mountain, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the sewage plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welschahl, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up. after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be depleted, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "to these extraordinary expenses came the continued support and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "stone houses made it clear that with the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance are" "" "" "" "fully penetrated." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs for wastewater facilities in the past 20 years, has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the above-mentioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the long run, especially since the utility area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility association cannot be extended because it is a deficit.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure made of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unique, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million more selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All absenteeism gets to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in which they were accused of promoting the application of black face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it proposed a filter to some users this week, which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote in an e-mail, whose tweets were widespread over the photos that the filter was "hurtful and the least unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "she added that" "" "" "" "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very contradictory Asian caricature and filter effects." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish-resistant, but that the yellow face has been moved to the decreasing extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolper." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it's much more difficult that things go unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticised the large part of white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinesich-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable in order to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, the company refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on subrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, on their part, said they had their Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership distorts ISIS intelligence, determines Committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual conditions were allowed, an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Republican member of the Defence Committee, intelligence committees and military budget committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret services analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence intelligence, typically drafted by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drew a positive picture of U.S. efforts against terrorism as the real conditions were allowed on the spot and were consistently positive than analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom are up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed enduring problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government peaks have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts" "" "" "" "stated the report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already commence in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after months of investigations, it is clear." "" "" "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressmen from Kansas, in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command's leaders changed the intelligence reports to reduce the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called on the Task Force after being admitted that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report released on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are under way by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom has created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," the high-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, announced a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process, Mr Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "harmed the morals among analysts and" "" "" "" "there was little room for differing opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Centcom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported on investigations by the Pentagon general inspector, who were admitted to complaints by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion on these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of divisions more than ten years ago than a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, according to government officials, the team around Mr. Hooker notes that contrary to government statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, reported the Times in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damal commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, the Olympics are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel steady and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself was a burning rod, which is passed from the watchstrap to the triathlete by the swimmers to the gymnast.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the waiting line in the Coffeshop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with oddles, could have been among those known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow there are sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should make modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping is an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it became so tenly noticed that many that I had questioned did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has some kind of outsiders, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and pigeon, the two sports that it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "Trampoline" stems from the spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Budding winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "they are evaluated according to official Olympic program according to completion, difficulty and" "" "" "" "flight time." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the goal, sometimes towards and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also in the TV transmission another hits the goal: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as a little tiring even when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumps off, seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too, a competition prevails, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; most of the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will blaze the final round as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic mania they promise a calm, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the spruce and the objective of male athletes - according to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base, according to the Wall Street Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses assert that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police at shot changes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia currently breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen killed and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests, probably from the last or earlier this year, show how security workers hit young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now calls for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Project Manager of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians in order to fight terrorist risks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive as much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy was expanding at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, where dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the vast expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest it," "" "" "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely-criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions escalate along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which were forced more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why the feelings of bitterness explode after years of getting worse under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies hiding where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians told them that they gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who mainly come from Ethiopia, prospered in the politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this, too, is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "" "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is usually dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, accounting for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, the secret services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on an unpublicized disease in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special agents to treat opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was in 2005 after thousands of protesters protested, apparently pledged by the government according to the statements of analysts and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan town, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a base for Dronenflights across neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's claim that ISIS was founded "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification created new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase of protection, in the peculiar position to explain the statements he had not meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump left behind the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism leaps down on Mr. Trump, while he has attempted to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to declining demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her talk dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Naturally, I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr Trump to postpone the linguistic barriers in politics and then to ruin them as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "according to what the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>

<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more cherished sound, since his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A recent survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a major lead over North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr Trump tries to not apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misinterpreting his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is intensifying in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherzer has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>

<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backslippers, completely false, and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by allowing the situation in the Middle East to be aggressive.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once talked about the price of the market, Café returns to Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The store Soap Cherie, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Indigenous people used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is changing, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excepted and club is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it is also re-inventing.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do so, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garniings like capers and sauted onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural sweats.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">On a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg and visited the club regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after being pulled to Greenpoint, she would take the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee drink for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was clear to me that it was on coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even though she ordered a blended Chai Tea on this day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a longstanding and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I came fourth after seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he had no resentment over the fact that the soap business took the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">Indeed, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for tasting with the coffee of coffee from the café as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think we will go on to her offer," "" "" "" "said Rodriguez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish residents, Greenpoints, also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he has prepared to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café is expanding to an adjacent building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was ruined on the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell it," he said.</seg>

<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with eating, was discarded as soon as the land returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebral is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">Born in 1624, he swims at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haie only get up to 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it really counts, the five meter long animal accelerates to a rat 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate by a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolution biologist suspected that Greenland will be stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice-sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have little knowledge of the lifestyle of Greenland Sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion was measured when they buried six animals with one transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks spoil the loot: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and look for cadavers coming from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland Sharks, who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest shark measured 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals, the carbon-14 method analyzed the lens nucleus of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lentil core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons searched for larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the other hand, with 220 centimetres of the third-smallest animal, the lens kernel contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapon tests, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland-sharks had, on the other hand, normal carbon-14-amounts in their lens-core, that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm long Greenland shark, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters would be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the increase obviously let itself at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible" "" "" "", "declares the evolutionist Scheuereck." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Frankfurt benefits from Brexit</seg>
<seg id="2">The city on the Main, therefore, has the best chance of attracting workstations and companies from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very likely that Frankfurt will most benefit from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the IW.</seg>
<seg id="4">After the Brexit referendum it is uncertain whether money houses should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the so-called EU passport, approval in the UK has so far been sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's what big US banks use.</seg>
<seg id="7">Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates with 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Frankfurt, such as the IW, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone, as well as other important authorities, such as the European Insurance Supervision EIOPA and the ESRB risk management.</seg>
<seg id="10">In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," "" "" "" "says IW Professor Voigtländer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Luxembourg certainly beats a big fund industry, but also cuts bad in infrastructure like Dublin.</seg>
<seg id="13">Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, the town features readily available commercial properties.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Paris it is not easy to find free high-quality offices," "" "" "" "says Voigtländer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the rents for first-class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than the River Main.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of the company consultancy Mercer, the city was ranked 7th, Luxemburg at number 19, Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 37th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though quality of life is a matter of preferences: "with its already strong position as a financial center for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.</seg>
<seg id="20">But London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Brexit-Votum, my economist.</seg>
<seg id="21">The balance of forces also speaks for this: in London, according to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, in Frankfurt, there were 62,500.</seg>

<seg id="4">Clinton's candidate for the vice-presidency, Senator Tim kaine from Virginia, published his tax returns in the last ten years together with his wife Anne Holton.</seg>
<seg id="5">They paid an effective Federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="6">Hillary Clinton and Tim kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency, "stated Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump conceals behind false excuses and retreats regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not obliged to do so by law.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.</seg>
<seg id="10">"they are on the move," wrote Clinton's election campaign helpers Ian Sams on Twitter, with regard to the publication of the Presidency of the Democrats.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Thursday Michael Cohen, Trump consultant, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed.</seg>
<seg id="12">Trump critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets, donations for charitable organisations, his business units and various other compounds, especially with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already overthrown the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday, prompting high-ranking Republicans Trump to publish his tax return.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Thursday, she also addressed the subject during a speech on the economy in Michigan.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations." "" "" "" "she said to the crowd." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">POLITICO reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday, stating that this could still be the case.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the election campaign, federal taxes have become an issue.</seg>
<seg id="18">Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett who would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million paying a tax rate of at least 30%.</seg>
<seg id="19">President Obama also supports the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="20">During an election campaign for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha, Nebraska called Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has here his seat to exchange trump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Buffett said he had been subjected to a tax audit by the IRS and Trump was "afraid" from the voters and not before the tax authorities.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clintons's campaign has covered its tax return by 2007.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, averaged an effective federal tax rate of approx. 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx. 40,5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">The 2015 Clintons' tax return showed that these only accounted for USD 100 of their income as wages, unlike most Americans.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their main investment position was a cost-effective index from which the Clinton's dividends and revenues were taxed by USD 109,000.</seg>

<seg id="3">The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which already had the idea for years, intensified its funding along with U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without violating animals.</seg>

<seg id="2">The young registrants from the care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were accomplished.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Roma pilgrimage of all the minstrants presumably two years ago, the Oberministrante round St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimages.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and one decided finally for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened portal of mercy on Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruene, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmer were on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Father Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and told the Pilgrim blessings.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Minster Unserer loved wife stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each day and evening the individual day-to-day tours were accompanied by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis started to sing together a song from a specially crafted pilgrim song to the field crosses, chapels or churches.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parish homes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage ends, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a delicious and hearty dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">Day after, the stage came to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at weaker heat, some 500 metres altitude had to be descended and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrim's day in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg on the final stage.</seg>

<seg id="18">With a little impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert, which arrived on the pilgrimage destination, was welcomed at the evening fair in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner last night in the men's team Sprint at the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took up the pivotal role his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London train world championships despite the resignation of Hoys in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Anfahrer- Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that is now unfolding.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who prevailed four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner scored an Olympic chord in qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British Trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hinder was scared, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner made it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear in order to slow down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny and Hinder as they climbed onto the podium.</seg>

<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an Olympic chord and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he was intentionally falling on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal by England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "Hinder said," "" "" "" "It feels like the whole GB flags on the grandstand as London." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of ten titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the bicycle.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is possible in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoys' victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a hive of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the Four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record that won gold in London in 2012 was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where the focus will be on Wiggins.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had contested yesterday with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding Women's Competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong train cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a number of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary demonstration of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April was in the midst of sexism and mobbing reproaches as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment has reached its peak, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of aluminum molten from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to run the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 workstations in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa joined the Point Henry melt which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Alcoa's melt in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-standing speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, where the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp are holding smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means additional physical demand for electricity through the melting facility," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL also stated that the contracts were called "hedging transactions," which should have come into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "therefore AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," "" "" "" "said the current supplier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on earnings on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the predictions of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual subscription of $187 million in "Expecation of a Termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "Skill Alcoas..." to operate the melt or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt would not be impaired.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have come into force from November this year, even if there is still one explanation, why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the industry's bad economic situation prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland use around 600 megawatts of power per year and consume about 900 MW of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "" "" "wrote Kendall." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashian's similar?), creeping reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz-uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacce).</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the clichy act of almost every birth episode of a children's show (Seacce brought the phrase "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With a view to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim might have beaten her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a volume resembling a fashion magazine more than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were of the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertisement).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover-star is expected so eagerly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine filtered through before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years there have been clearly more "celebrities, the modesty" as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good snapshot video (even if everything is true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistletos of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings grew up again when the news came out with the release of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the displeasure seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all their sisters sell images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her spare time she is seen on Reality TV. probably only to see her sister Kourtney and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">More than 160,000 of the country's relief operations are rejected by the community centres every year, while the industry is preparing for the effects of further mitigation on already overloaded transactions.</seg>

<seg id="5">As of June next year, it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.</seg>
<seg id="6">The director of the community centres of Quebec James Farrell said that the last survey by the National Association of Community Centres revealed that thousands of people were rejected each year.</seg>
<seg id="7">Farrell said that the situation would only get worse without the suspension of the Federal Government's decision.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Queensland's community centres are underfunded, meaning that thousands of people of important services that you need are rejected," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and oppressive debts, families who have been released by separations, workers who have been released unjustly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can't get the help they need.</seg>
<seg id="10">The federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent in June 2017, meaning that thousands of people in need of help from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.</seg>
<seg id="11">We call on the General Prosecutor and the Federal Court of Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these shortcuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for guidance on the national average.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their community, and that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the pending elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (18 September) there are considerable losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute Insa for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in both states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is fought between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would rise to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Greens are reluctant to return to the Schweriner Landtag despite the slight losses of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">With 3 percent, NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the SPD in Berlin had only 23 percent of the polls (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They are still paralyzing the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but on the left hand, 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">With 14 percent, the AfD would be represented for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, the Pirates would, on the contrary, miss the move in 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator was launched on the market.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good at hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory initially was eight megabytes, which would go for about two selfies with high resolution today.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they come from the Stone Age of the Internet age somehow.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twenty years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer show in Hanover as an office in the west pocket format.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could have a lot for that standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabited by the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus could have repudiated similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly moved on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate lives and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposed its daily side of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus similar to evolution that had previously been suspected of planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen withdrew only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained behind with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Pleiades</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why the stars in the star cluster rotate in different rates as well as in which context the rotation periods are associated with planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared processing and analysis center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-run of the Pleiades is 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They turn the fastest now.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these mature stars repel large quantities of starvation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is ageing, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star-spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, whereby bigger stars rotate slow pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as the ideal Cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is still much more than we would like to learn more about how the How, When and Why stars slow down their rotational rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The tears ran faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days of Base-Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional resignation, the 41 year old pro will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees for the last time on 12 August against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say" Goodbye "to both," declared the 14-star All-Star Game participants of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times, Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player in the league, and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">He signed a 10-year contract with 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will act as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player, Rodriguez paid for a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Navy (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and Yankees he has made some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the Hall of Fame members, Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players in the most important statistics show similar figures.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the 41-year-old is not likely to be included in the Hall of Glory of the Baseball.</seg>
<seg id="13">For so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so contested is his appearance outside the place.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN" between 2001 and 2003 to have taken forbidden steroids.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games due to an involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal by the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect to have received high-performance anti-aging clinics in South Florida for years.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a legal dispute, the lock was reduced to 162 encounters.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the league might even have done me a favour for 2014 because I played through 20 years without a break," "" "" "" "said Rodriguez at that time sweet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Also his farewell days are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends hit the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my job does not include a farewell tour." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"my job entails trying to win any game," said Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who was married to Diaz by actress Cameron and actress Kate Hudson, was sympathetic to the fans of the Yankee archrivals Boston Red Sox.</seg>

<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A well-trained athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official acts of doping have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 metre barrier runner sibla Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil - immediately prior to the start of the critically acclaimed athletics competitions these news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen last Sunday the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Sport (CAS) confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the events of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news leaked over the positive sample at Danekova, the 33-year-old went into the offensive himself.</seg>

<seg id="24">Before the launch of the athletes, especially the case Danekova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association prohibited the entire Russian squad from the start, except for systematic doping, and also the Luminous nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the previous offences in China caused violent clashes between the athletes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide erpresses hackers their ransom payment</seg>
<seg id="2">Blackmail programmers are currently using targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware protection specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a Ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly pay the ransom salaries demanded by the perpetrators, in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, specialize in attacks on corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially lead-out ransom is much higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programs were still designed to send adverts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attels took place in the past months shocking fast.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files, such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the shinsomware and deletes the originals in a sustained manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is incurred if a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals already have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "" "" "does not pay, you only support the problem," "" "" "" "says Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay are getting their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study investigators of F-Secure examined the user areas and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay using Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively low-risk profits from Ransomware blackmail, hackers become more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware around within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">It is more probable, however, that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software toolbox to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware-kits were created by purchasing the malware, counseling and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of supply includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set from a criminal and commissions another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then delegate Spammer to spreading," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of respondents in the Malwarebytes survey trust that ransomware can repel ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption alone is not a sufficient threat to successful registration, the offenders are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take up completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Defcon chopping conference, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter the activation of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then instead of the heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the little HR-V Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well-finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is down there.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage box.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l at high-up and 1026 l when the back rests are folded, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like cinema chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the 650 mm boost height is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should do his job a little quieter though.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another version of the engine: a 1.5 l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">Four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>

<seg id="19">The safety systems include the city emergency braking assistant (working at speeds 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "the collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as" "" "" "" "approaching objects" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the recognition of traffic signs and throttles the speed when required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is available only for top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, navigation system, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol station from 20,000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">The weather has made the shooting star Guckern a line in the south-west of Germany on the night to Friday - but there is still hope.</seg>
<seg id="3">The night was poorly suited for clouds and rain to observe the celestial spectacles, said the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our hope is on the night of Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The weather should be good, then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="6">The shooting stars are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216,000 kilometers per hour.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.</seg>

<seg id="1">Restful night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night one lies awake for hours, in the morning is already far ahead of the wake-up ringing no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are various causes underlying them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society of Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. an inhalation and sleepiness.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the sleep that many people perceive as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently is the sleep disturbance expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is common especially in case of depression," "" "" "" "says Weeß." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to think about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, tell the jury.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, indelible, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate the sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping tablets only occur in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - as treatment options.</seg>
<seg id="22">Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin, is hardly available in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, you should first contact the family doctor if you have problems with your sleep.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise for example snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of sickness, sleepwalking or if one does not find the cause of a breakdown disturbance, says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "please don't make a nap," "" "" "" "says Fietze." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cladding, one goes to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping person.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It also counts: regular sleep and rising times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleep, avoid drinking alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to count immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deizer has sold himself to Olympis via Facebook for the disappointing cut off of the DSV team.</seg>
<seg id="3">He took gold for the first time in Doha in December 2014 and at the same time set his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deizer has been protecting himself against his ex-teammates who protested in the criticism.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 €bonus and a jungle king of €150,000 no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page during the night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveying system in swimming is bad, but doping controls are very good.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a band, the suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and luggage steels.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civilian officials in the Dusseldorf Airport became a band known to the police officers from past acts of theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences this year since the middle of July and have proceeded jointly, in division, and especially professionally.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the criminal commissariats 34 can prove four actions to the Dieves, who had travelled to Germany to commission criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had caught up to more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a remnant of cobblestone streets: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem like this at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one passes the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolad.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "someone has sprayed" "" "" "" "ugly!" "" "" "" "on the facade of a grey house." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it will be built: a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy neighborhood" as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, are preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly the interior senator Henkel has spoken out several times for a tough action by the police against the project, called the "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22 the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadets, were cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on the spot, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and one day later the police and construction workers removed from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk vorm late.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is attracted by three children here, are mostly of the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from the vanishing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police open between occupiers and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today has a lower average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared under large police forces in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and election-makers from all over the world: with them local residents from the GDR times and former occupants share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the rigs are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on raised windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with colored bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "no other road was mentioned this year along with the words" "" "" "" "leftist violence" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: criminal offences such as physical assault are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make material damages, which tend more to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as for acts of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal record, on the contrary: "here, one helps one another, lives together in the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important for her to get back her road: from the police, the politics and the media, who in July all suddenly demanded the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former gaps that the old inhabitants are displacing.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well-equipped are living here," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I cannot really approve violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for trailed people who are angry about colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who is moving into a pub, complaining badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be called with their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is mixed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer of the working group indicated that the honorary officials are more than thankful that Deuschle is now here, the yodelling wool milchsau, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant that some - less mocking than rather on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long experience in the field of social work, an egg-based wool milchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been with us for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position on a three-year term.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the building, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office to the commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it has not been possible to rely on private apartments, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be notorious as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay there are internships, apprenticeships, training places, one-euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reported Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do not charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "this is" "" "" "" "no employment therapy" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and, above all, language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Thus, administration and community of volunteers also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is central that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who develops the feeling that he can't help nobody in Urbach, can't work and be unprofitable, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem cases, says the customer honestly, "people with whom nothing is at all." therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always also to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization after the latest occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no," "" "" "" "Regine customer says quite clearly," "" "" "" "some naive may call" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these incidents should also be addressed by the refugees." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would completely discredit them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "says Regine Customer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary official must look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have always been in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is not afraid to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Urbach we have not yet reached where we want to go," "" "" "" "says Annika Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no new refugees, that would be able to relax." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbach has already been utilized to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, predominantly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
