Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
they wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
the confrontation will also involve the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington har@@ sh@@ es Israel &apos;s ongoing housing construction and re@@ jects Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had declined with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
Professor to have shot his girlfriend in an emergency call
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb said with a somewhat timi@@ d voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand @-@ written notice that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to undo , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point .
by the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university that forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motiv@@ ate .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a cover for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ yl Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb began his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
in the spring he completed his doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy .
one of the long@@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar play .
he was then the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both appearing on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together with one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night saw him the last time in the night of September 5th , after Lamb had finished his guitar and mou@@ th@@ piece organ in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no evidence that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students , and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Memorial , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
classes are resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb made the call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us states that there will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to recru@@ it 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will begin with job interviews and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , Christmas markets are getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip shops with employees who sell , send , and deliver products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox swe@@ ats about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Date &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater awaiting the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and a measuring @-@ length of it to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

UN CEO states there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN CEO once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
Mr Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the Regional Po@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks at poll@@ s , it did not work ( yet ) .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising her@@ man Cain , of whom no one even won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps staying power and start to drop their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
the popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l of the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten would say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see tr@@ ump temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the country &apos;s first country of choice , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nonetheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six out of ten independent states say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they set up their preten@@ tious hats , repub@@ li@@ can vot@@ er Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money to J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters can look at Tr@@ ump Camp@@ a@@ ign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump sums up almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ umps leadership while anti @-@ dump@@ ing support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump sums up the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen in order to change that , and no one can truly say to never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their minds are twice as common to Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on the issue of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; from Mexico two months ago , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with the issue of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of repub@@ li@@ can voters , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa reported two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea , is located here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg .
in the street , one square meter of a th@@ at@@ roof house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - therefore the high price .
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top apartments , however , the price is just like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ cker has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , well noted .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ time scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to make the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze created a dream start in the &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally pick up the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third run .
at his 28th results in the Champions League , Müller received gra@@ cious help from Olympic champion Roberto , who suffered a f@@ uss of the World Champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 1,@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without glit@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the Royal Class , among them famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled here in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bra@@ vely , but in their offensive efforts they often went to work in@@ discrimin@@ ately .
the attacks were often initiated by reloc@@ ation to the left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which rarely passed against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k struck out of the right half @-@ field in the upper left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es of the Pol@@ es ( 26 ) .
then by direct acceptance , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although Bayern was their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set the needle &apos;s pin .
but at goal keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
so , for instance , when he drew a shot from the idea of the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Guardi@@ ola defended a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later .
before the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block evi@@ dently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked with bat@@ ches against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only damage the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : with disc@@ la@@ imer drops the risk quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to exceed 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is due to more frequent gum inflamm@@ ations in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment returned to the level of non @-@ smoking , explained ground @-@ author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health down to the old age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population ages between 65 and 74 years of unemployment have been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble on rem@@ nants of the late anti@@ quity in Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer
for the repeated time archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the building site for the new bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said the museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called land@@ marks since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural History .
in the third section of the bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists now find what they are looking for .
from text documents it had already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and steep@@ le , a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman is unhappy at the railway station in the G@@ id@@ ent@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ der , the Federal Police asks the people for help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman crossed the railway station towards the station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .

EU Commission to fight new court in dispute over TTIP
to reduce the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration devices for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its mode of operation corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish has proposed to bring the proposal as a European bar@@ gaining position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP is set to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come from the EU , the US and third countries .
a second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow obj@@ ections to be lod@@ ged against judgments .
until now , the participants agreed on arbit@@ ration , and there was no objection to their judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an International Investment Court according to her own data .
there could then , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which is mainly demanded by major corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the large opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , over which companies are liable for compensation for tax pa@@ yers , le@@ ver@@ aging national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organisations like Camp@@ act have considered the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it was critic@@ ised , above all , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission took into account key points in the reform that the Federal Economic Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel elabor@@ ated in the spring with other EU Trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government , too , welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the legal action of the economy by too many new rules .
it was said that small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ pin .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he re@@ counts on the basis of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came into being and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into the great opul@@ ent atmosphere .
the rum@@ or arises : &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be followed in a row .
but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
they live with guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; Come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ rowing ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after a very productive experiment , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) .
this sixth studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but programmed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
since the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows are here for the colorful spectacle made of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
dark@@ ened Ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theatre is mainly presenting the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly more rei@@ s@@ su@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can throw away the &quot; sla@@ b in the bottom . &quot;
only to an en@@ core does St@@ ev@@ ens damp@@ en himself , plays acoustic little older songs and finally bows to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the premi@@ ership
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the premi@@ er of Prime Minister has been eag@@ erly anticipated since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s outline and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will raise himself to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip a few sessions to leave colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guidance , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has been the focus of several newspaper pages in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of Shadow mini@@ stries have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party initially supported him as a leader .
the BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent says that political differences are also within the Labour &quot; st@@ acks &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference said Labour Chan@@ ges set aside to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory boss , across the dis@@ patch box in Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised another politi@@ cian , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the outline of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from both &quot; impact &quot; and stri@@ des with re@@ fut@@ ation , and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that when he does not participate , Angela Merkel , the shadow of economic minist@@ erial minister , will represent him , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he has also expressed the idea that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch &quot; theatre , often linked to the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ tures . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broadcast on television in 1990 , the FB@@ I was considered to be the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his fellow parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argue that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has risen sharply to data , which indicate a rise in the UK wage growth . parallel to this , FT@@ SE 100 has been increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid target .
between May and July , the result , excluding Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom , rose by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and quick@@ est rate since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over the acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
after encouraging news from the competitor Group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by selling stock as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the equi@@ ties of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
J@@ D Sports CEO states that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ boy said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs for his company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
J@@ ustin accompanied hundreds of fans yesterday .

since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bi@@ eber House : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster hangs in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives is just as much as their M@@ um E@@ wa earned in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ kt@@ oria would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you obliged to attend school ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bi@@ eber himself doesn &apos;t .
that looked after anyway .
for the advertising in the advertising print of the Super Satellite he collected three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le firm donated many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and about the counter , Bi@@ eber also c@@ assi@@ es .

he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to potato @-@ don@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato @-@ don@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg I@@ mb@@ iss@@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da Movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him to the idea of a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen on television by chance .
since then , in his shop , a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wered with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now sign@@ aled to the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash starts a campaign for the fight against al@@ di@@ - invasion
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthened their relations with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and equipment carry out its annual investor strategy day .
there is much in the game as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley expect Al@@ di to pick up about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening his first markets and take away all available actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s with a high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath stated .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market shares in the Eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most faithful ones .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will decline in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has dropped by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the company &apos;s operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to offset sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refurb@@ ishment programs will be set to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association , Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , who is often referred to as Special K@@ s , has been ra@@ zed by the not@@ orious examination of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent , R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison calling out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have fought Cy@@ rene , and I should sm@@ ash the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp@@ ing hit a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open but he is not the first player to break a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also did not support the decision to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z when making an important decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everybody , but he is securing the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part . &quot;
&quot; at first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe Nick has made the climb very quickly , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes in the eyes of the public , and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . some time out of the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declares the emergency and lev@@ elled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed when hundreds of migrants picked up in a No Man &apos;s land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ clam@@ ation police .
some rejected food and water in protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be returned , while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a meeting in Brussels without a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not set its hopes for a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency summit conven@@ ed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison prisoners were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree with the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that there were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come here by damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of com@@ mitting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car had arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the border .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 succeeded in getting involved , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 per cent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains .
Clinton has a big margin among women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support with men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s benefit for democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton has a big advantage over older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin among the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries across the country say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly excited about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with problems and choosing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president op@@ poses a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want him to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den does not decide to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton increases his lead before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; percentage has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about the elec@@ torate .
similar to last month , not a single Demo@@ crat candidate or potential candidate for voters of the prim@@ aries stands out unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters of their party &apos;s prim@@ aries .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best cut in hon@@ esty with the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him .
democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters did not have an opinion of S@@ anders .
having questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server during office hours as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was worsen@@ ing .
they are mainly Republi@@ can , more than six out of ten , who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of voters do not consider it to be an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country also see tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good grades in the lead .
among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut best in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in a nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey is eliminated , and others are losing their support dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support national tr@@ ump in large numbers . support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted ahead of Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and that Tr@@ ump is sur@@ passed among repub@@ li@@ can voters with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen in the deepest place , from 10 % in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e , and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son goes up in the poll@@ s - he ends up with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also revealed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son exc@@ used to ask Tr@@ ump faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only remotely , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , distributing the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police reported .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches and then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gling his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g to contact the National President of the Brotherhood to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically ordered the welfare of the Brotherhood above Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the first five members on charges of murder .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of false attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned it , we will also hold it accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has withdrawn its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest is coming , and the domestic trip is falling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance on the process .
a recession occurred within just 11 months after the first rate of interest rate rise and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus when it begins to raise interest rates but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement might have been exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things more volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market is usually upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ den@@ zi@@ ally occur later in the increase @-@ in @-@ year cycle and the return on loans thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases they often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product near its lowest point will be at the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 had only twice the nominal GDP less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants were prepared for the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading accounts for only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all increases in GDP from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions sh@@ aded very quickly after the onset of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares when they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the initial increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bond yields fall immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer bond between longer and shorter loans and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , yield curve is flat , credit margins have widened and volati@@ lity has risen - all features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and entire business , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit from interest rates rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be po@@ orer , as rising dollars will make their products more expensive in the global marketplace and finance their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with weak balance after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the majority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising amount of dollars .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ mate Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked The Voice and said it was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; changes &quot; to Classic FM , declares a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham also said BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly does not differ from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from its commercial competitor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn anything else about classical music anywhere .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it must work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport to tramp@@ le on the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in special BBC mode .

Internet sales climbed slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed spending in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Guardian of the Guardian &apos;s selling index . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that comm@@ utes itself , and we may see that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases from this event taking place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers sites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium has found that a little more than £ 1 has been issued online from £ 5 .
in some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are worn by Muslims during the first funeral par@@ ades in Mec@@ ca .
Saudi Arabia puts down the collapse in part of Saudi bin Laden &apos;s huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que .
those who were filled , largely dressed in white , took the distance to pay their respect when the first of the dead approached their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then to the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king hung a san@@ ction about the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was supported .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the yearly H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already said that the p@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have let the arm of the crane stand when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree issued by the State of Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was forbidden foreign travel .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rush@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the large mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and is undertaking major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ruled that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other players receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss states that the time of cheap East European tra@@ des@@ people is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled East European arti@@ sans who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can circum@@ vent walls skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush , you seem to belong to a minority today .
for Br@@ its increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , the head of the company is behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
this is why King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open up 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this more strongly towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group failed to reduce the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have been responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ duction on Wednesday at the K@@ lagen@@ furt regional court .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with abuse of authority .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the tor@@ ney @-@ attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants used to use funds from Club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage will amount to around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
this fact was divided by the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the dis@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represented that there was no time for an asset to the association .
the sports officials would only have charged expense allowance and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money , from debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( about 4@@ 4.000 EUR ) .
&quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we carry on or close the club ? &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read profession of large @-@ scale char@@ tered accoun@@ tants of the Finance Office .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance as security is laid down by the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , no debt can be made .
furthermore , in the case of financial success , compens@@ ations for reimbur@@ sement of expenses have been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , a portion of the allowance compens@@ ations have paid off only years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus was deposited in the account .
as a result , Pau@@ l@@ ump and not detailed discounts appeared , the former Ob@@ man explained the operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and austerity books jointly managed the two defend@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judge asked why the dis@@ bur@@ s@@ ements were not disclosed in detail .
the association has not been interested in the details of financial issues , it is important that only debt relief has been important , so the answer .
when in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigation for office abuse started , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants asser@@ ted .
this securities account ran on behalf of the second accused and , according to its statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know how to answer this question for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified .
this transfer was form@@ alized as a &quot; claim res@@ titu@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why claim compensation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge and the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All of you are of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
on diets he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not pre@@ tend exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they explained .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
in his statement , he explained in his statement that all the deport@@ ations were to be carried out in cash , to which he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg .
the main hearing continues on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard drives another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction that has been ongoing for three years , the computer giant will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the sub@@ missions of the US @-@ Compu@@ te H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate divisions .
as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs , which has been ongoing for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
on the stock exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share gave rise to 2.3 percent .
the group , which has grown up with printers from California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led even more in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers to its services set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has been re@@ plying until late that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more shops online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mainly be rejected : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 percent agreed .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed in the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ d@@ as and water @-@ head@@ lights against several hundred applied refugees .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the break @-@ off at the border control point .
he told us by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water cann@@ on ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially replaced the pepper spray .
after that , the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way , the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now somewhat withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
the world watches when the US central bank comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether the interest is raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists sur@@ vey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was still last week , thinks the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and interest rates on the current stand of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications suggest that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
shadow of death at the Delta State University left Exc@@ use Let@@ ter
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues and killed his colleagues - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he &quot; am sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of Ge@@ ography and Social Sciences at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning .
and he said that he was shot on someone , and someone killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that police must send police officers to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the notice , he passed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police pick@@ led him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb took his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his curriculum vit@@ ae on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a big corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa group aims to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the roughly 1,000 executives worldwide will cost the workplace .
there are , however , new negotiations with the pilot union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgrading the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to contribute to a profit contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management team headed by Chief Apostle Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in future .
with its real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of u@@ row@@ ings with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organisation of the company &apos;s 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s roof , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of tari@@ ffs with the cockpit @-@ cleaning cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the strike @-@ out strike on this Thursday .
this is what the union divided .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outer def@@ ender to tears and exclu@@ des him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al gives the hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen prior to being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 is very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say a mo@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I &apos;m getting stronger again . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK distributor has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and when you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u .
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very poor here . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it by heart .
unless you are perhaps David Cameron .
when he was asked by a child care provider to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read about my children , because it always seems to give an image or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph describes the story of the book in which Cameron describes the story of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this was not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment becomes frustr@@ ated by the curious , trees f@@ elling , th@@ need kn@@ itting once @-@ gather@@ ers despite the protests of the nam@@ es@@ ake Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ at@@ ting , snow@@ y creature , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral district office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to push Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a one @-@ out victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related News : Adam Ly@@ re leaves the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ re is of course difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are geared to results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ re , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully when he kno@@ cks out further ado for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss commen@@ ded his attitude , even though he did not deliver such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test pun@@ derer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ re got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got ahead of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton received nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England initially deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ re was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a hit man , whom I highly in@@ timi@@ dated .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances in front of him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave mos@@ ques beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and four squ@@ e@@ aks , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made it and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him , he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see their statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew England has made some clever additions to the coach station .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ den , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is responsible for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can profit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh breeze , even when the news is in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break from Australia and I don &apos;t have any problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Great Britain from the EU ) could gain momentum if the economy is in a sl@@ ack@@ le by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented re @-@ negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states are deeply ent@@ angled in various crises such as the EU is now and not always out of their own fault , Great Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
prime ministers and finance ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it is always about me .
my European boy@@ friend , who wants an outside looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Merkel chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain one left .
it is hard to imagine that they will be able to pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore perhaps some such ministers even deliberately do not plan helpful notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has gained nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar Ones , as they did not , during the 1975 referendum , inspired our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you can &apos;t remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone h@@ ack@@ ers , and the pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ foreigners who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , it was better to distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , for Bla@@ ir had the principle of the unacceptable Constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly bite on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time more for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , an error back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ Sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; official position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Europe is - I just press it friendly - in the development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ dency and the wild cap@@ ill@@ aries of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism may well say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs strug@@ gled in him to not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet , without going too far and losing his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but fighting to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s &quot; expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours &quot; support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home in all .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
alle@@ gations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) closed Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Law Review &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis , &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim by P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions about the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the Refer@@ ences of BA@@ T on Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he participated in the meeting .
the group &apos;s research work indicates that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims by P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serve as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prof. Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die each year in terms of smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
through the clear presentation of recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former Head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ on and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ disputed time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC &apos;s General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not think for a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least give your production to programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time frame , because they want to achieve the greatest possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax financing programs that could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm to it .
I am trying to see how this should be public broad@@ cast@@ ed television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC is to blame for ratings &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ on should sell .
Johnson said that the more public @-@ law niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks and they can argue that if they go to their apparent missions to justify £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , remember all , we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 per year , ask me if that is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
the former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , explaining and talking about the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane can@@ als that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the lit@@ ters .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report of Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically engineered the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when using ultras@@ oun@@ ds on the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground breaking tool that allows scientists to switch and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

in September a s@@ warm of arms dealers will go with the DL@@ R ... Custom@@ ers are asked to help stop the weapons fair .
the 300 posters have been issued by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum for cruel designs in Ban@@ sys .
a collective entitled Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the London distribution and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ 5 pack of Allen keys claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet is gaining . &quot;

according to Gav@@ in Gr@@ ind@@ on , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside of galleries .
many artists participate in the work and realize that they have to move outside to the real world so that their art has an impact on society .

V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the ar@@ mo@@ ury - through a laying of the Ex@@ ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic disgu@@ sting corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it stays stronger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors are f@@ elling fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now do I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I upset - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entry into student resi@@ dences extends from slightly ner@@ ving to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie up : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress themselves and put on their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with your university
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space B@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I &apos;ve used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
how to kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw a few things .
friendship closes through che@@ eks .
as you start college at the high point of the Back Man@@ ia , kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat make people sleep when you kno@@ ck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to steal food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check it with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with a balanced diet as my room@@ mate who added a fl@@ ush@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the word you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors if it was a thing for them to make drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted with more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5@@ am , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before leaving their own music , shut down her door and set off for her three hours trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come to the same residence ?
on the other hand , it would not be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , come to her , separate herself and then have to see her every day , and perhaps see how she draws together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to persu@@ ade your subordin@@ ate a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good st@@ ong is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
teach by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t forget someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the single mother and the low @-@ wage ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ deb@@ tor , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tor : the mass accommodation in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ deb@@ tor : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when one puts people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tor : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , excluding plot .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ deb@@ tor : I have dra@@ gged down my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking regulation .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees and asylum seekers have no cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ deb@@ tors : there were those who accused me of creating luxury structures for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
definitely not right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable homes ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even everyday people need housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the ear@@ ner .
I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today .
that is what it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing on &quot; General , &quot; and then &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , since they receive an error message telling that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by sli@@ mming the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and re@@ install them once the process is finished .
it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is close to a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may stop half@@ way and this could lead to a breach of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
Schach@@ club Schach@@ club Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot charge the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent research should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro searching for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; Anton@@ ini@@ ft senior centre &quot; have joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro was recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services provided by the nursing staff .
for years , with our ambul@@ ant care service , we have established that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; we do not often claim many services of the insur@@ ances because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner of the house Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ine and the Bürger@@ hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is committed to prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the Senior Management Centre for Care and Care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the main reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is the demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , as Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined at the inauguration ceremonies , the district office also devoted itself to the balance of the old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ alised get @-@ together . &quot;
this gives the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings as soon as possible .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 am to 12 o &apos;clock .

witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a sevent@@ een year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young man and hit him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg@@ ged in this case and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he initially left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and went past demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one didn &apos;t see the car anymore , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
by using a head@@ stock one applied to the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
up to now only one vag@@ ue work description is available .

doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing in many places in the country : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich succ@@ eeds in the coming months with half a point .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opens the practice again on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10,000 in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ den@@ si@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their specialist training at the Ver@@ dener Hospital and will also enter into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ehr@@ inger and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the mil@@ ler liked the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss as well .
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller has also grown up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ Will@@ ing@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19th the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ehr@@ inger works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( boarding school ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both intern@@ ists , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and exercise EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the rub@@ b@@ ish has a subsi@@ dy of € 50@@ 000 within the scope of a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ fel@@ l , around 2000 patients arrive in the field of field breaks every quarter , in the north @-@ German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ehr@@ inger in A@@ sen@@ dorf , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too .
anyone who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s Consul@@ tation is still looking especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
the par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the medical profession has been practicing there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ehr@@ inger gr@@ inning .
after the long time , she already sen@@ sed a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ pe@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; the boarding school says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband comple@@ ments laugh@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to grant asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering the &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses .
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not look like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the Schengen Area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia doesn &apos;t want to lock its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must complete his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to leave T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia in the night hours to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade denied that it was to encourage people to enter certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it .
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had travelled all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
thus it could indeed come to a slightly further west stretch for the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then the EU partners have consistently issued a good certificate concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees are now travelling to the Croatian border is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down on Wednesday morning at a local presence in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees already started distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have belonged to a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which has been accused of having gained an insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the collected information insi@@ der business should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says SE@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 others continued in the case .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce in Mannheim for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim par@@ ade@@ platz .
people get their err@@ ands , partly fast stri@@ de , partly comfortably wander@@ ing .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car terminal at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
urban railways hold .
puls@@ ating , big life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big tablets each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid made this action attentive to its 20 years of existence and is fully confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the middle of the city and people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the voluntary workers .
while some people spontaneously go to the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life , &quot; &quot; read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences such as &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again there are little discussions about the action on themselves , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I realise that for me at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is co @-@ operating with the charity association of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
therefore , this public action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to publicly communicate on the tablets , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the issue of death and dying is still associated with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people .
an assessment that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mourning companion is one of the voluntary workers of the first hour .
faced with the subject matter , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was called for volunteers by calling for volunteers , she immediately reported to her and had been there when it was founded in 1995 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - those affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce of St. Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are all well trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of an out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables the training and training and supervision of the dying and mourning companions .
training sessions for new employees are offered every two years .
the pla@@ ques described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
even there , other personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his earnings outlook for a year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ man transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower level of view is due to price increases , which are an average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and effective on 4th January and despite higher rates for ground transport of heavy and large packages which will be collected from November .
the company said that it is expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which forec@@ asted 12 analysts asked by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts questioned expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has in recent years recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought the sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results for F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales rose 29 per cent in the bo@@ d@@ segment , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result fell in freight business due to higher labour costs .
in the after@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days a week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at the end of the orn@@ ate two @-@ storey cour@@ se@@ room is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by unprecedented attrac@@ tiveness through the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is soli@@ dly growing , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives fear@@ ful to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the estate agency Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is sufficient justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a rise in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only indicates a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed raises the sentence unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts are sof@@ tening the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage jump@@ ed 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she needs to go very far in her explanation to calm down the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed regards as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was continually below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets around the world were sent together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial verage value fell in May by more than 16 % below its maximum level , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with D@@ ow now almost 10 % below the high level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculations , when to raise interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not the main concern of F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in the decision making process .
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed monetary authority of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mere hint of the former conductor Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market moves that seem not to be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
enam@@ el , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates an increase in interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark rates by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able impacts on growth in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crisis , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate determination .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ osen said , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I do not believe it should hurry ahead .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : a small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still teaching her 74 l@@ ences .
every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different from a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ di@@ atric Society Rio Grande fav@@ ours nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Pap@@ al organization SP@@ RS attempts to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with images of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ried community approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ nasi@@ um building on Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports ground is progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent municipal council meeting , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously agreed without any major discussions .
before that , the Panel had decided , among other things , an application for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; and &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about the permission for a special form with respect to the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , a &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ center first and roof top &quot; should be erected .
the planned use of the roof area for solar plants is the background of the planning : &quot; this means that we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
the &quot; liberation &quot; in turn led to the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ment that is supposed to lie below ten degrees in a different way than in the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan permits no &quot; exceptions , &quot; with respect to the en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ment - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Community council generally proceeds restric@@ tively in the case of deliver@@ ance moti@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the rever@@ b structure is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from the promotion of school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented to the district council office .
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at the hospital in Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the staff moved from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this was shown by the surprising plans of the Regional Hospital of the Land@@ kreis , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , on the coming Wednesday , 23 September , a decision is made to the Supervisory Board .
if plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year , has spark@@ ed a change in private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over leadership from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; appreciation &quot; in every case and dissemin@@ ating the offer in the field of &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inner station .
for the next two years , with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to carry out both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has more than 35 beds , is to be closed permanently in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ ed rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ rat , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ bed psychiat@@ ry are housed there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to Le@@ ch , who has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , detach@@ ments were closed , for example , surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ isches HC .
the leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal , though , is the clear favourite , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener entered a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and got something good there .
Jag@@ ath with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the cultivation on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in use as the police told .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly the accident could happen was unclear at first .
det@@ ectives the criminal police .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police into the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who had been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor and police told on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was also arrested on Tuesday evening , was also suspected of being admitted and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had come home after visiting an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the event of interviews in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee said to the police inter@@ ro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse put into the canal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a decision on the nearer circumstances of the act is intended to bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gaps
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable homes .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pressing for a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable homes , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be finished in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in a first accommodation unit .
many then come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing construction policy of recent years .
Germany is moving an apartment deficit , which gets bigger from year to year .
currently some 77@@ ,000 units have already been missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , while Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study , compla@@ ins .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of a flat share of flat share rooms .
young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should boost the social housing construction .
thus the property tax will be dispens@@ ed with and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended .
in addition , attractive tax depreciation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee accommodation in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros was rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia have a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary is practically no more transit , more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Home Secretary , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the abol@@ ishment of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have come to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day Hungary had sealed its border with refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically rendered superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to reach the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet border f@@ ences .
for this , the border strip hides other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before closing on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws categ@@ or@@ ise the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a criminal off@@ ence .
for this reason , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted were sentenced to five years &quot; imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authorities , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit regions &quot; set up on the border , including almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
but practically no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers have begun to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border area was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to sell himself to the goal of this conversion .
after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reached only a few refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country has also reinforced its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but around 20,000 migrants were still in the country following government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the instructions of German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were occupied when ten people were suddenly standing at the door of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ ased the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to this we have only once sti@@ p@@ pled the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man couldn &apos;t afford to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very pleasing to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els on Sunday evening in W@@ els in a regional train in W@@ els , after the announcement that the rail transport to Germany was stopped , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was stopped at the river Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ able on Sunday , on the day before a bi@@ polar run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of ai@@ ding R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially entr@@ en@@ ched the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ es circle of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poultry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must also state that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ lowed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing floods of refugees and the coming winter to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers .
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad searching for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof lod@@ gings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full with the transfer of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word &apos;s weight .
the government used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place neighbour@@ hoods for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already gotten a grip on the may@@ hem at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen Main Event Centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not have homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great vor@@ ti@@ ces , &quot; Con@@ rad said , and praised the organizational &quot; masterpiece . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had conversations with the people of the country .
they would have assured him to create lod@@ gings for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , explaining how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private persons can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that neighbour@@ hoods must comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the upper decks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , explains that in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior he is more successful at accommodation .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further notice of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs for the Republic as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , the own neighborhood search has not been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for housing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
according to Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) , this is not necessary at the moment , since the parties concerned can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures .
however , further sites should be checked for suit@@ ability for emer@@ gen@@ cies .
the city chief critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has ak@@ kor@@ ted further action on Monday in the refugee question .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
it is still possible to continue the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
the guards would , however , be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria goes back on its borders again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general renovation of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz industrial line has been officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology Centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the New shi@@ py@@ ard and later re@@ acquire them .
right from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million was invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2,@@ 700 square meters of rest area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ propriet@@ or opened second shop in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit just wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ada : after all , she got an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and gown of different manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor in the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large room Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I feel most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ ture when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional lady can &apos;t answer with last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag adds to every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called investors .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , poses journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office bu@@ sts the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts well with it .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dresser &apos;s hair is a concept for many in the win@@ emaking village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ town are related to him over -@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ stadt representative Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native of K@@ all@@ stadt has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous children , including Tr@@ ump , the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he was living in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to believe that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
accidentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
tr@@ ump , therefore , comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche Succ@@ ess Story started in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was first sale in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their wish to return to the homeland for a long time failed on the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once had been cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally marked statements of the descendants .
he repeatedly compla@@ ined about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ em@@ ates , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born dr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the American more dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so high thousand . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension engineer Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ at a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine it from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , which has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
the Upper Bavarian town of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to assume leadership in Today Show

the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the stand did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers with the five major cities compared with today &apos;s 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winds of change affect these early people more than the Parliament ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the big novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ael Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 .

the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail by 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Th@@ em Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , when Sam Wood ended up in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will surely not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two , you may have accidentally added a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have expressed themselves in a ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man , and in doing so called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and saw ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that &quot; Wood &quot; could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; she said .
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle have shown great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a fight as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ting at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the locker room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ nes in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his desperate catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry Hay@@ nes p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ nes and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ nes left the field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ light 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a po@@ orer start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ nes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ nes compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sur in Groß@@ wil@@ stadt before a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Friday Free @-@ elec@@ torate &apos;s State Parliament conven@@ es until Friday in the Frank@@ ish Commun@@ e .
quite different main topics were actually planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the war in Yugoslavia during the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Sp@@ eller CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as quickly as possible .
therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum cases : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards across Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more capable of acting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in the city wall should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing tor@@ ney remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Central Post plus &quot; at 47 high schools , in which an extension of the upper @-@ gym@@ nasi@@ um secondary school from three to four years will be tested .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to do so .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever you want .
stronger Wall Street helps Da@@ x on jumps
the German stock market closed with profits after a long @-@ stretching and nervous trading process .
only in the afternoon saw a fir@@ mer start to the US stock markets for a clear direction , which finally promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward .
M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized scores won an increase of 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .

the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as a benchmark in the euro area rose by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
trading posts in London and Paris also recorded solid gains .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in plus .
many of the stock markets are counting on the markets until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the great decline on the fut@@ ures markets on this Friday .
the debate about the burdens of the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to record a record low and also left deep traces at E@@ on .
according to Spiegel , German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered slightly , but ultimately always lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &quot; appeared from the weekend .
accordingly , investors are currently receiving too little attention from the German chip@@ maker .
investments in future @-@ looking waf@@ er technologies and focus on the car market should be paid off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were once again sold than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers of the automobile manufacturers Daimler and BMW grew by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside of a police station , some of whom threw rocks and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high rate of death .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ rec@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the trial after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post shall be reconstructed .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the Old Post youth centre .
preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for corresponding offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor may be questioned is not yet clear .
in accordance with this , no agreements have been concluded .
the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that is located on the Ring Road / corner Große Straße , already some months ago and the building that is there@@ on can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans of the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several residents are still worried - they fear selling out their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday res@@ ett@@ lement on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused investors and management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went on the offensive from System Construction Management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
strong reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner and member of the board of advoc@@ acy of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge cl@@ utter domin@@ ating all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics that the traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase strongly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus loads to pay off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well @-@ known area of the former restaurant , is , however , still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ a@@ ign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a charity donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that are to help thousands of refugees who have crossed the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to posting the donations call on its blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus journeys as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : MS@@ F Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5.5 million were doubled to goo@@ gle@@ .com / day low to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery study .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan used Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I under those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded the diabetes condition at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was achieved entirely by only one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level decreased from around 9 percent to about 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as it reflects in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish the mortality rate in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather recorded a complete erection of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery will lead to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried using conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies between 27 and 30 using his BM@@ I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly being noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school , and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story the novel might be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we must think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the United States attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of intake of hand dis@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of strong alcoholic san@@ iti@@ sing drugs called Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income of hand des@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centers reported , increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children dis@@ infection intentionally drink while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only for a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection agent within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sp@@ lashes of fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to the treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legal for an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ebook physician who treated her in the winn@@ ings Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ur@@ ked her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head , Rit@@ chie said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ ner Scott , Sarah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ infection products out of the child &apos;s reach .
beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredients .
health officials suspected that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by explaining anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes her from her room .
the police considered the en@@ vious plan as &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p , &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football bored D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic people , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here do not only talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars di@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic war has to fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ings to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the succ@@ eed@@ ing withdrawal from the Champions League the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now has five points ahead of the table , is clearly at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this exactly the same way - but we must go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we really need the support provided by Celtic , because that makes players better .
standing together is so important .

the impro@@ b@@ able bee was re@@ buff@@ ed after he admitted having sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the stri@@ ker and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it &apos;s not for Celtic Glasgow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice &apos;s Supervisory Board has trust in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s board of directors still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attract &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es dre@@ amt that his team of Aber@@ deen didn &apos;t have to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a gap of five points to Celtic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in cups or games that have not won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is increasing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period without labor for the United Kingdom .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the rate of 5.5 percent , as shown by the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) figures .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland , David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ts the drain
since the security staff could not satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officers could take the stur@@ geons into custody .
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adol@@ escent was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 mil@@ le and initially stayed in custody .
why I will witness an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch a man being killed .
when it happens and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the history of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he &apos;d do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ingham , a re@@ porter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective , I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a unnecessary death .
man after wet police persecution persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he over@@ came the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called into Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the hum@@ orous design of a Ben c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards attempted to spy on him and threaten to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobal@@ t sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months for the sp@@ ying repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said .
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I would like to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I am trying to do my best for them .
when they start to think I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb rise in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a fraud .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , current President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it will be personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L become cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with Li@@ dar@@ i for the long @-@ lasting investigation of cobal@@ t , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race response rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like that last night .
it could have been like yesterday all day , which was so .
but it also had it on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against rival because of claims regarding ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critici@@ zed the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ setting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the Storm players &quot; ring struggles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney &apos;s qualifying final on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a scar@@ cely concealed note on the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
Bell@@ amy champi@@ oned the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ p of his team and said that they were only focused on their contact with the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the critics of two leading trainers in his team were confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we did not change anything in our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this appears again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points anything exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team was free on this weekend , because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit after drug delivery
a man , who might face life imprisonment for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and arrived in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole crowd and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of the criminal case , he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security in common to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ lu@@ ent statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ated his Australian and his Serbian passport , register with the police daily and stick to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and in vain tried to escape to the left , as the police told .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident cause ri@@ pped apart completely .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from 6 hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
damages amounting to 12@@ 2,000 euros were incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet , &quot; and he said , &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ct to be addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping .
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the telephone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have included in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , on 25 January of this year , and did not appear before court hear@@ ings on 24 March of this year .
Gregor S@@ im &apos;s defense lawyer asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his transgres@@ sion .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es the verdict of October to receive background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted deposit in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was taken up before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
floo@@ d@@ gates switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the floo@@ d@@ gates were increased from fear of discovery and arrest by people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Tuesday more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were walking over bridges and st@@ ow@@ age to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registration .
compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station again met significantly more refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 8 : 00 , around 700 people arrived in the state capital , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sand@@ storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is expected in the south @-@ west &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm clouds in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air is currently circulating in the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strong &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong point &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled out of the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to the DW@@ D it is still to be expected in the Black Forest on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom @-@ sea circuit with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years , the car@@ makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , it was above all to see movement in the compact cars , which are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : some 28.@@ 1 percent of the new registr@@ ations fell to this segment in August only in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be presented in this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury and luxury cars .
one of the premi@@ er premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
to ensure that the volume model is also sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive either .
Opel launches an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17,@@ 650 Euro .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , with three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will be added to the new compact car next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ dan@@ e is only a five @-@ door in a conventional and one accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
he comes to the trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a station wagon .
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan offspring wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton@@ meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers first put a hand at the front end : here , the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed above all , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Te@@ gel , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated from the room .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now free on foot , had been reloc@@ ated to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant for the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the judges under@@ took the judgment of the Berlin Court Court and rejected the case for re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dressing of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money la@@ under@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , only in April did they claim damages because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without a separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity .
moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe was also confirmed by the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ humane accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff at that time was lod@@ ged between 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel in recent weeks .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ ckets it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 are to be dropped in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record a million refugees according to the German Federal Ministry of Justice &apos;s forecasts this year .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot;
what is coming up in Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are used every year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as before ( 250@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units from the rental price are falling each year , and refugees are also applying for these particularly favourable apartments .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social apartments annually would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion euros a year .
in agreement , scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial whether they can find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the migrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence requirement for asylum seekers being restricted to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of the views prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of German knowledge .
so far , there is still no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the establishment of networks is the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few sought @-@ after parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only once quite important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ et@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family nevertheless from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators is increasing by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacities - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also of teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
students willing to study in Germany could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
because refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or den@@ unci@@ ation do not receive benefits after the asylum application law more if they begin a study .
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to the board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , this funding gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student Union .
the students should receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ churches law to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed translation of the Basic Law into Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be much more than today a subject of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , and the erosion of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result of European decisions , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination center and a General Equ@@ al Opport@@ unity Act for a decade .
but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U series of mur@@ ders showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organizations and interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and which international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany commit , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the previously anticipated refugees , &quot; says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money needs to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery claims to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals immediately when registering health cards .
services rendered could later be accounted for by the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seekers performance law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , the doctors make the language barriers more difficult .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s offices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , she demands .
many refugees would have been helped , however , with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among the refugees , for example , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and the young people are about HIV education .
but with some of the other sick@@ nesses of the disease , German doctors tend to get out of their education , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees even doctors .
however , in order to be able to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill following estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is getting trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash @-@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ical workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to attract each age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick @-@ was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current stage of management .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family for more than 33 years .
this means that the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic for different animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at her : &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well for our animals , we are not doing well either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read off by the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the highest Command@@ ment therefore : caring well for the animals .
the Pro@@ bst family is very proud of their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ mare .
the two animals lived together for eight years in a walk and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the cir@@ cus , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 people , we always give our best and are there with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animals are open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations of de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen
last month they had boo@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Members of Parliament that immunity ends in Parliament and as soon as they leave parliament its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing enterprise hardware and service business activities .
the expected drop in the workforce leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive , who is to lead unity after separation .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; a statement made by the company .
it spl@@ its up a company founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the turn@@ around from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the wounded Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided that his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in contact with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of the 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a reasonable period of time , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need to take a little break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al pulled the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al has never worked out .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up has now become more desperate than ever before , as demonstrated by suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Liv@@ ing@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ a@@ ign against a pi@@ tiful life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of man , with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had an adequate high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
in the age of communication through social media , with a focus on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun @-@ loving and successful , even though in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , shining through interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone pastoral ministry explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ mon@@ place has really shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the fully re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helping PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched its Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally reached their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head of the head in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t score one or two more gates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris Team after his injury , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he entered into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s passport behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some fla@@ ws and bad termin@@ ations , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who in no less than five attempts fell only in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shooting , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well , the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour mark .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could keep low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate in the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level .
qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off Paris !
it was a great game of them !
gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through share sales
the Gl@@ en@@ core mining giant , which is resident in Switzerland , is affected by collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge school student plan .
the London @-@ registered company Gl@@ en@@ core stated in a statement that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling raw materials prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of rights of reference resulted in a rapid rise to the top of the London stock exchange when trading in early Wednesday morning .
the share was 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to wipe around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns about long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar
on Tuesday morning , 49 people arrive in Weimar after a long run .
the refugees come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youngest of these young people is a six month old girl from Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and reci@@ eves President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state d@@ iner , after the two leaders have led bilateral talks .
&quot; President X@@ is &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi give the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreement , &quot; adds the statement .
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on their way to Washington before traveling to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi are addressing a number of controversial issues including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber @-@ sp@@ ying of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 shift to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
Bayern was obviously just a few years ago before Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion champion , twice champion champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he was before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we have nothing , &quot; he says .
and this is also known by FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to have a Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in memory : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he got me with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s class triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays a great role in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity then do it with the cast of the film and not by filling the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about - whoever will be the director - as they treat the character of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni t@@ witter @-@ user expressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation is at the forefront of social debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after killing Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national impact and urged the legislature and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against colour content .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums quiet matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , the leader of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ esses who were invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operator aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task included climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of the big prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about , I &apos;ve never earned or lived more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life is changing , he gets the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt exactly the same if they had changed the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
Min@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins turned a chance to climb in one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three R@@ uns possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish strongly this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the hit wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aus@@ mus said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked clearly better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a Two @-@ Run .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double @-@ Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe scored a double play
after Detroit joined the Garden @-@ Run at the end of the ninth session , Wall managed a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed man stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit became the pr@@ el@@ ude to the game of an even non @-@ mobile Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the play after he had missed more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es issued a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third , Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos , followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not hit well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed man A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a breach of the throwing school .
he is studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris will be removed from the list of vulner@@ abilities to fight against the T@@ wins .

hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who arrived there should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sport halls of the H@@ esse state capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived at the presi@@ ding board responsible for initial admission .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective way@@ far@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , it was glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international assistance to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian interior minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained on Tuesday evening in Austrian broad@@ caster ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s been agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there had already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed out conversations on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ Route .
most of the time their destination is Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees on a special meeting .
in view of the strong influ@@ x of refugees in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this jointly with the countries , Merkel announced on late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who would need protection are saying this too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead @-@ eye view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly parti@@ tioned in the round .
the Chancellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are meanwhile stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest to fence the border with Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from moving over Romania .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile eye witnesses reported thousands more migrants on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds el@@ cel@@ a@@ dus a global ocean is sw@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what researchers conclude from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the moon progres@@ sed slightly on its orbit around the ring plane .
this motion is only small , but still too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; trade journal .
it was known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not clear .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for one month .
an investigation has yiel@@ ded an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Münchner Leu@@ ven , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view on the possible commitment of a non @-@ prof@@ iting professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove its ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his conc@@ ussion week , Tor@@ sten Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie returns to the team training again .
already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is expected to enter the running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent collision at the head .
contrary to his first fears , however , he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line will often be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruit thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet dishes .
however , a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hearty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz divided on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n is partly blowing through the cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a drop of temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of a comprehensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the top of the alpine side , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the cam@@ pers of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to penetrate into the adjacent medi@@ ell@@ and , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday , tum@@ ble dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ hang .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter will have to be accounted for in the next 48 hours , which has already been large rainf@@ all in the last few days .
on Thursday morning , blow up the air , a cold front with a powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind speeds up strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop considerably .
the following days are in the north @-@ east with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , an un@@ named place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honored as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live in secret for centuries as a minority only in secret .
the square is symbo@@ lically visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city as a her@@ edi@@ tary ba@@ bel back then .
according to historians , his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated a split in the Western Church with his theses on the decline of the indul@@ gence .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar has painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means equal with &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , the respective themes can be quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar has been working on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
there are cycles that focus on topics such as cross paths , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translated into current context &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ ally mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original text of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 , and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Her@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened once with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up that , in order to be able to bear me again with the Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art to more significance in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have another pleasure and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt decre@@ es that the viewer can &quot; fall into &quot; the images , let them work on themselves , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Scrip@@ tures in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art to be : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not pay attention to completely compreh@@ ending the Bible , but also selecting the mysterious subjects that are important to him .
&quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here are the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen wall pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , companies commissioned to model earth hill for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was finished .
there were failures in politics and administration , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railways .
so hill de@@ ported , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to report the approval in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then start without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to Sah@@ ar@@ an refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga set a clear mark on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its aid in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next Wednesday I am in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
soccer can and may help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive turn@@ out has to put politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some of the federal authorities also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will &quot; help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is about everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can do football , no , we have to use our jet force , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements have started their own projects in their locations is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this year and next year , the association will jointly present 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO lo@@ oses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the case of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a glass of water after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was impot@@ ent , then drove out of the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important for him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everybody can do something like that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as a reserve driver for the two Stam@@ ina pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button on weekends , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller at the door
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have completely sh@@ attered in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only alter its stem el@@ event@@ h position on the R@@ eus position .
thus he announced a change at the door of the door .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Chief Finance Roman Ci@@ tizen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ chel left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ging statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final entry for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League should be the goal , middle field player Julian Wei@@ gl considers understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological van@@ guard when it comes to changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the home of transport minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure fewer jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with representatives from the industry at the IAA .
the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communications .
in order to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use it internationally for the maximum speed allowed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government is also planning to change the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver gets more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less cars on public roads can only be expected far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look scep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the audit organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent will only reck@@ on in 20 years with this , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respon@@ dents up to 20@@ 25 reck@@ on with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Digital Union of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , however , the traffic in flowing traffic could be 15 percent , in traffic jams 45 percent .
every fourth would give the car the control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l announces team and double start at table tennis championships
according to the current state of the title , the Düsseldorf @-@ based club will only open in sing@@ les from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision will be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European course in Düsseldorf .
Bol@@ l found himself at that time on the flight to a long term customer base in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side is , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; Timo was missing at that time and we became European Champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should orient@@ ate ourselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United suffered a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mix of a very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung on September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude to a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made a stop in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly @-@ looking work of the man who has written a fashion story without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total artwork for which a lot of effort was carried out : in order to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a Sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot secured 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later contributed to designing fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first own fashion show he could not pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers who worked on them for example for blankets and curtains .
this alone doesn &apos;t work today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Pel@@ j@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the lau@@ dry lace , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt men@@ tions some examples : lace in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styl@@ istic epo@@ chs , represents an increasing surface potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
Mo@@ dena P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ ö together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customers in this way .
nowadays the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively through chains .
it also weak@@ ens export , currently to Russia and the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer says about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter recently revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball peak a few years ago .
in doing so , the machine sti@@ cks little chi@@ cks at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gold@@ smith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I could not start with traditional Indian lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the subject of P@@ lau@@ en tip - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who want to be a mem@@ ento .
so I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to join a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it &apos;s not about a new movie but a kind of continuation of 20 years after the first movie with the magical n@@ anny .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already strong : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods , &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned with the steering of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and new place for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Xi said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Leadership Group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) to include private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
according to the statement , a negative list will be created to identify sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is of great importance as it assign@@ s to the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a right @-@ wing business environment and open the market , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting premi@@ eres Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish , thus increasing consumers a significantly higher dose of the ven@@ om .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has received a corresponding working paper from the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t from F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so polluted with mercury today that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 per cent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this attrac@@ tiveness , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values for other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ ps , are mostly so low @-@ loaded that they respect the planned maximum values already today .
the lowering of the cl@@ ergy is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver , which alone helps the economy , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t .
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is highly enrich@@ ing over the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can cause especially in un@@ born impair@@ ments of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum values in force , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazards of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily due to the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written reference from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations push more than six tons of mercury per year , two thirds of the total em@@ itted in Germany .
