&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures used in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safety measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear devices for unknown purposes as well as the det@@ err@@ ence of such a branch by the risk of early detection .
to en@@ rich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ al with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is made by an explanation in which material quantity specified for each material balance zone is specified for a specified period of time , stating the accuracy of accuracy for the specified Me@@ gen .
in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organization is making full use of the security system of the community after article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown of material balance zones .
in the application of their preventive measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following methods and , if necessary , see how they are more closely determined and useful in supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , manufactured , disp@@ atch , lost or otherwise removed from the existing core material and inventory ;
B ) evalu@@ ating the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measurement uncertainty ;
( C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for determination , testing and assessment of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing appropri@@ ations of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system , which points the core material for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock including the one and out of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures after this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) If ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circul@@ ating under the letter c ) , is introduced into the States , the association of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material with , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other nuclear material produced in the States in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit , so it is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The provisions set out in this Convention shall be concluded for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not subject to the provisions of this Convention , the Association shall temporarily not be able or desirable from resi@@ dues , the organization and the community shall consult each other about the use of suitable securing measures .
B ) The securing measures proposed in this Convention shall be concluded for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community establish con@@ sensual that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in gramm@@ es or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is above 80 % .
at the request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es core material which would otherwise be subject to security measures after the Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total of the core material delivered in the States is at no point any more than
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of particular material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ part square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the liber@@ ated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the security measures after this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are taken to that material .
the Community meets with the organization Supp@@ le@@ mentary arrangements which are necessary in the scope , which is required for successful and effective accompl@@ ishment of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in the individual as to the procedures established in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be expanded or changed without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within n@@ in@@ ety @-@ nine days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report described in Article 62 , the organisation presents a summar@@ ized repository of all the core material underlying the security measures of this Convention , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its audi@@ ts .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization ) on the other
the E@@ WG has decided to contribute to the special action programme laid down at the conference for international economic co @-@ operation in order to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the contribution of the entire member states is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table , which is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account called &quot; Special Trade Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory &quot; which consists of the funds held by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement , and uses ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the transaction account is separated and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is carried out in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the member state to pay on demand in the currency of the respective state to an order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction and to be depos@@ ited in the organization in question in question .
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the order within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the manager agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every Member State may be able to make payments before the above dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes roughly proportional draws to the cash or the school in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and balance the transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in gran@@ ting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by following factors according to the conditions of the EEC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without compensation ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and swi@@ ft@@ ly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered for the ordinary funds of the organization ( i.e. the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the transaction account may not be used instead of the funds provided by the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which have been approved as part of a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions which apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; thus , they are rep@@ ay@@ able in the period of ten years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are rep@@ ay@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this clock are directly to the organization which it re@@ tains .
each transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is specified .
the recei@@ pts from each transaction loan can be used for issues in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who , according to what the administrator defined at the time of loan guarantee , could be recipi@@ ents of a transaction loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of transaction loans are made on the transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator .
in addition to the complete allocation of all the transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ WG about the projects and programmes approved by directors in preparation , through the directors approved by the directors .
during the time of rep@@ ay@@ ment of the transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC quarterly on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
the administrator transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account closure .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the manager of the EEC also transfers a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction account .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the transaction account , the amounts paid to the account received from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the rep@@ ay@@ ments to the Member States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Comm@@ unities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time conduct an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special transaction sheets and on all other issues concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the organization may arrange , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties shall be invalid with immediate effect .
if the entire amount of capital taken by the recipi@@ ents is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and referred back to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties will be termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fied the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Comm@@ unities to termin@@ ate the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat dra@@ gs these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close the stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks have a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agreements could be closed up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the mechanism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units of accounting ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deplo@@ y@@ ments of member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are called below , to which the BI@@ Z would be ready .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without having exceeded a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as during the extended pro@@ long@@ ation , the BI@@ Z would charge a loan opening commission .
in addition , the first draw should not be made before the exp@@ iry of the stand@@ by agreement before the end of a month , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the results would take place in the BIS at the end of the agreement at the disposal of the available currencies , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the funds of the Bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BIS paid at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely match the market .
if the BI@@ Z has to proc@@ ure the necessary means by itself on the market itself , the interest rate applied to the application could achieve a maximum which corresponds to the Li@@ bor raised by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the consent of the Council of the European Comm@@ unities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close the stand@@ by credit agreement with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks have a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
I honor myself on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set up provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are covered as follows :
- Fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount according to the community : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ case weight ( 1 ) .

the total quantity mentioned in number 2 is set with the day of the Greek accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could adver@@ sely affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el@@ - and Lamm@@ fell on the common market within the agreed amounts .
in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions , so that the shipments of inter@@ vention@@ ist conditions on frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation on the sale of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for exp@@ orting H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only occur at prices and conditions , which are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional part of the world trade with these products .

the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way as to wai@@ ve the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the products in question .
in implementing provisions , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals allows the quantities to be issued for the export lic@@ ences ; this information may be de@@ cryp@@ ted to destination country , if necessary .
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
it regularly checks the tendency for the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions that are of importance to the target number 7 .
the Committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper use of this Agreement will not be imp@@ aired by the fact that products of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned above in the agreement .
the Committee disc@@ usses all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply irrespective of the rights and obligations of the parties as part of the GAT@@ T .
the year set under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 March .
the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount and accounts for the seasonal nature of trade .

the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid market development , which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the common market within the agreed amounts .
in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions , so that the shipments of inter@@ vention@@ ist conditions on frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance .

a reag@@ ent for blood group determination has to react with all tested blood samples that contain an@@ tigen which is the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance on the label .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by constantly re @-@ di@@ lu@@ tion of the reag@@ ent to be studied on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ tre is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ ene di@@ lu@@ tion in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood @-@ body in@@ undation in total volume .
in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has defined international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for the determination of blood @-@ group determination , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity , norms are elabor@@ ated at the time .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ans who are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for determining the blood group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of th@@ inners during ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floods .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lu@@ tion of the reag@@ ent in the final mixture within a series where a microsc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood type determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tration of unknown reag@@ ent compared to the International standard prepar@@ atory or a state standard preparation in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) .
if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain according to definition 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .

if a reag@@ ent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be kept for at least one year .
the ex@@ piration date of a reag@@ ent in a liquid form according to the label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the ex@@ piration date on the label for dry reag@@ ents depends on the results of the ex@@ piration tests ; it is appro@@ achable by the state supervisory authorities .
dry reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and that is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry reaction may only lose 0.5 v.@@ d. of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ us pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry reag@@ ents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the reag@@ ent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the reag@@ ents , regardless of whether in a liquid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or particles or visible particles .
the reag@@ ents target@@ ing international exchange should not be dy@@ ed arti@@ fici@@ ally as far as possible , at least as long as an international agreement about a unified system has come about .
reag@@ ents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the reag@@ ent contained in a container is sufficient not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity available in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of reag@@ ents for blood group determination .
reasonable samples of all reag@@ ents set out are to be kept from the laboratory for a long time , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
reag@@ ents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups by the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin exclusively contain substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin .
in each case a black printed label is attached to a white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
