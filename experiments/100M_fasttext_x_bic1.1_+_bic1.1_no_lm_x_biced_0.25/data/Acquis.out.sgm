<seg id="751">The receipts from each transaction loan can be used for issues in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who, according to what the administrator defined at the time of loan guarantee, could be recipients of a transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of transaction loans are made on the transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="753">In addition to the complete allocation of all the transaction loans, the caretaker teaches the EWG about the projects and programmes approved by directors in preparation, through the directors approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of repayment of the transaction loan, the caretaker teaches the EEC quarterly on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transmits the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction account with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the manager of the EEC also transfers a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction account.</seg>

<seg id="1129">- Fresh or cooled hammel, lamb and goat meat (02.01 A IV a));</seg>
<seg id="1130">Within the framework of this agreement, the export opportunities for Hammel, lamb and goat meat from Argentina will be set to the following annual amount according to the community: 20,000 tons, expressed in carcase weight (1).</seg>
<seg id="1131">In order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement, Argentina agrees to ensure that the amount of the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the traditional supply forms (frozen or cooled).</seg>
<seg id="1132">Should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade, the two parties of this Agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution.</seg>
<seg id="1133">In the event that the community takes up the protective clause, it obliges them to ensure that the Argentinean access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the event that imports from Argentina surpass the agreed amounts in one year, the community reserves the right to suspend imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1137">The import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Accession Treaty; this shall take account of the Hoechtel set mentioned in number 5.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The total quantity mentioned in number 2 is set with the day of the Greek accession to the community to 23,000 tons of carcass weight.</seg>
