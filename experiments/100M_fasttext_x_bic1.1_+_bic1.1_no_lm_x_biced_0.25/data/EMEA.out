it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ amine tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ res thoughts and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not available ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder where patients have man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods of abnormal elation ) with periods of normal temper@@ ament .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and to prevent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution for inser@@ ting or the fusion tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , as well as A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; meaning chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three trials of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that were suffering from increased anxiety , compared over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence , compared to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased anxiety , compared with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and plac@@ ebo for a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly greater in reducing symptoms than those who received a plac@@ ebo .
in applying to the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
moreover , A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y prevented up to 74 weeks of effective plac@@ ebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controll@@ able sugar ) , tre@@ mor ( fatigue ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nausea ) , s@@ ali@@ vation ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and fatigue , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Dru@@ gs ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I distur@@ ban@@ ces as well as in preventing a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes were out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in the quick control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for placing A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y across the European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and whose man@@ ic epis@@ odes approached the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , daily regardless of meals .
an increase in efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ologic study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated suicide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ oc@@ el@@ ised and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , resp@@ . an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is needed if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the c@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites .
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects , and similar can reductions should therefore be undertaken .
after placing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data conditions for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients treated with gloss ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those with lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was measured for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
there was no medi@@ cally significant difference between the patient groups using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were observed .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine di@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine di@@ 2- and D3 receptor and for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ ty .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients with response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate showed significantly greater improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks on stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal &apos; weight gain &apos; was significant fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed an efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a reduction effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in part lasted over 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum lenses , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ fall , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ dra@@ tion and hydro@@ xy@@ modelling of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on extensive metabol@@ is@@ ers via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia .
a single @-@ specific analysis for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ zer@@ o@@ genic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the G@@ all of monkeys in 39 weeks and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the average steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine di@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution to intake with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical c@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .

A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of det@@ err@@ ence and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be termin@@ ated and the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be started .
in order to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under b@@ yp@@ assing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
in case a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medicine for A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with in@@ toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which have been otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ oc@@ el@@ ised and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , alter@@ nating levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy volunteers used Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as a single @-@ piece intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and the simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ is@@ ers , compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after placing the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .

the following side effects were more common in clinical trials using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % was measured for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
there was no medi@@ cally significant difference between the patient groups using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were observed .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mort@@ ality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ gi@@ dity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant greater improvement in the symptoms of as@@ cer@@ taining and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed medium bet@@ tering from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score for the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on decreased number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients with response to study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( or@@ ally ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate showed significantly greater improvement than Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks on stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal &apos; weight gain &apos; was significant fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in part lasted over 2 weeks not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum lenses , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior efficacy in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study of study in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ fall , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection the AU@@ C after applying the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in two studies with healthy volunteers , the average time was applied to the maximum plasma level for 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were between 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on the reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure were observed , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ zer@@ o@@ genic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent secondary kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 @-@ 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in ra@@ bb@@ its , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole dose or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine contained in a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it should also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) found that in patients with whom the first treatment no longer suggests more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , it was not necessary to use other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xi@@ an Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted , until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with imp@@ aired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which may have substantially other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in the patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ l number is increased again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly indicated car@@ dio @-@ toxic@@ ity was not proven with ab@@ norm@@ alities , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if the patient receives nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating remedies .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contra@@ cep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to produce no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should consult a sperm @-@ conservation before treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the transport ti@@ ghtness and ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al phase III clinical trials .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , increase in weight , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart diseases :
dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ ia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , pain in the g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kid@@ neys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , joint pain , dis@@ comfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the composition of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in trans@@ forms the trans@@ it@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and has been proven in in @-@ vitro studies that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ate receptor and due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ anes for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ linked studies and of 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III compar@@ ative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an inf@@ usion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received treatment with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in form of sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medication for preventing an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; first line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity vs. pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural progression of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to the sound of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30 and 180 minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
exposure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to an intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or tissue band@@ aging of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue hist@@ opath@@ ology , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ aboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , suggest@@ ing a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , there are only a few data available to patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogenic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , be careful when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile injection , it is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pass bottle .
after complete addition of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the water bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete full board of the powder is done .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that has already been approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; Reference In@@ sur@@ fers &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood fer@@ til@@ isation which may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , in case a blood @-@ blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be monitored before treatment to ensure that iron deficiency is not an iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been inserted , which enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a v@@ ein as an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein before they either switched to ab@@ se@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for effectiveness was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were switched to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as with those who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally cause symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ ra@@ ine headache and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as injec@@ ting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , proof has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the launch of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( for example cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in the case of planned larger surgery procedures which require a large blood volume rate ( 4 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients in which the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and complications may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability of patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose needed for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial dosage 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for control of the an@@ emia symptoms .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te count increased by ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl three times a week , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by &lt; 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be ab@@ orted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ tainment is required , should be given at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme begins , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the sub@@ routine therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days before , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ sti@@ p@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery and which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ sti@@ p@@ enia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ disper@@ sed PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of efficacy , defined as a reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of non @-@ respon@@ ding ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ um toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be weigh@@ ted to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended under section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the application of epo@@ et@@ ines when the concentration of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in is increased by the concentration required to control an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration recommended under section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet a di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should consider a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients that need to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the H@@ b rise is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ a@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of post @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ins did not prove that they could improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was targeted from 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
when epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rite .
from in @-@ vitro studies on tumour tissues there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF in relation to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ emor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retinal ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ gra@@ tin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sides and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate portion is identical to endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .
38@@ 9 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ dg@@ kin lymph@@ omas ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ mal cancer , 64 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 more ) .
in 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ zin@@ ome , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ours and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ es .
survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these trials were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etic patients and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an an@@ a@@ emia based on a number of common mal@@ ign@@ an@@ ists consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than with the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved following intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 in animal @-@ experimental studies , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to a dimin@@ ished f@@ ö@@ tal@@ low body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to a rise in mort@@ ality .
these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .
as part of an out@@ patient application , the patient can store ab@@ se@@ amed once for a maximum of 3 days outside the fridge and not above 25 ° C .
the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a sti@@ cky tab , so if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned indications .
21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the Member States , the holder of the licensing authority has to provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmacy with the following information and materials : • Education brochure • summary of the features of the medicine ( technical information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging supplement .
the owner of the license for placing the drug has to make sure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is furnished and functional in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. the drug vig@@ il@@ ance system has been established before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in the transport .
the holder of approval for the placing on the market comm@@ its itself to the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the Pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. including the Risk Management Plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • on receipt of new information that could have an impact on the current safety specifications ( safety specification ) , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures within 60 days after reaching an important ( Pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or Risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • after so@@ lic@@ itation by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from an un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) in one month before your treatment , there is a risk of blood c@@ lot formation in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) , for example , if you have previously performed such a drop of blood
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clusive disease ) , the carot@@ id arter@@ ies ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ ves ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which rec@@ edes again in case of further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated before the beginning of therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an@@ tic@@ ular ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ sti@@ p@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ sti@@ p@@ ia , it will break down your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor can take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or del@@ im@@ entary signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet subject to di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine the values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood c@@ lot formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occ@@ ured in the past ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and can adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if you have a bigger orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the beginning of the course of treatment and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood gra@@ ft after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may optionally arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are a means to build the immune system , for example with cancer chemotherapy or in HIV ) .
depending on how your blood type ( an@@ a@@ emia ) respon@@ ds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed on two equally large injec@@ tions .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your physician considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to spray Ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ emor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( quin@@ ce ede@@ ma ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as t@@ ing@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ sti@@ p@@ enia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - irrespective of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood c@@ lot formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post @-@ post th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces ) when your starting level is too high
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the side effects you listed significantly imp@@ airs you or if you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a trau@@ matic her@@ nia like H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) in the three days after the inf@@ usion can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
to treat the disease , A@@ cl@@ asta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a has been used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta .
in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2,@@ 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered hip frac@@ tures ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two trials of a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indicator for efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) was norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study of older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to plac@@ ebo .
compared to all patients in A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ asta side effects occur within the first three days after the inf@@ usion and are less frequent in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients , A@@ cl@@ asta is subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the Inf@@ usion Body and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
A@@ cl@@ asta is providing information material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the use of medicines for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for placing A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packaging supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease .
after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently under@@ gone low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended , as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and young people of A@@ cl@@ asta are not recommended for children and young people under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . ( see Section 4.3 ) .
a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is advisable to provide adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatments with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate decreases the risk of oste@@ opathy in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation reported in cases of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those who received plac@@ ebo ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after application was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get study .
in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip fra@@ cture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the inf@@ usion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tomy in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which have been treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including zinc @-@ cl@@ eic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients by tooth extraction or other dental operations .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area of a patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the event of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ asta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 1,5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ severe existing spine figure ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing spine survey .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures in A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one reduced by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased bone density at the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment significantly at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ asing the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the overall waist by 6.0 % , the ch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es were taken out of the pel@@ vic membrane .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta inhi@@ bited B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but majority of patients received an initial intake of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ asta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treatment increased compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment BM@@ D at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ Treatment conducted over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % of the threshold .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once daily administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly dose of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 with radi@@ ologically verified , mainly mild to moderate mor@@ bus past@@ ing of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg cit@@ ric acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day during 2 months was proved in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta was treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and more than 5 and 15 minute persistent inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma level rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large circulation with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a prolonged period of elimination with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the quick absorption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zinc acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the bend ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clear@@ ance of met@@ aboli@@ zed substances metabol@@ ised by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed by humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in 64 examined patients .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function problem down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
since severe kidney function distur@@ b@@ ance ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0,6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in trials on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials involving intraven@@ ous use was administered the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats , administered as a 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to 7@@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common infection with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , an inf@@ estation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages decreased from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
in ra@@ bb@@ its no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum levels of serum .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ tai is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ onate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease &apos;s disease .
decl@@ ining blood levels of sex hormones , mainly o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is structured uni@@ form@@ ly , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alizing bone structure , ensuring normal bone formation and thus restor@@ ing strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to harm your kid@@ neys .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta along with foods and beverages you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta for two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ tures .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
as A@@ cl@@ asta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood after inf@@ usion .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta may work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before stopping therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta if you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take notice of your next doctor appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent inf@@ usions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
currently it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ asta is causing this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta .

allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , n@@ ettle rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if one of the side effects you have significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ tures .
before and after administ@@ ering A@@ cl@@ asta , patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the fast implementation of the effect of te@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atically current , hypo@@ kal@@ ene can develop whose maximum occurs normally within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the packaging supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , A@@ comp@@ lia also suffers from a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or over , respectively , which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and also one or more I
four studies were also carried out in more than 7,@@ 000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used compared to a plac@@ ebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive agent for setting the smoking .
in contrast , the studies on setting the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was hard to assess in this field of application .
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts amongst a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable with con@@ current use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of use with HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or clari@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

in addition to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or over@@ weight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 based on the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
even in patients who - besides obesity - have no disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related individuals may point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

the difference in the middle weight ratio between the 20 M@@ Gs and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction .
the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( c@@ max = 196 ± 28,@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ t@@ rough = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) .

patients with black skin colour can be up to 31 % lower c@@ max and have a 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
it is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old male patient has a 21 % higher c@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old .
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on safety of adverse events that were not observed in clinical studies , but were observed in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area were evaluated as potentially relevant for clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initi@@ als effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or menstru@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR to the public . this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated . • It can be applied together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily set with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ n or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ one treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in doing so , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tos lead to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by applying the dosage of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional application of ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea in a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the addition of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who also took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high testosterone levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos as part of a mon@@ otherapy ( for sole use ) should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for placing ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. premature cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with higher output liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper abdominal dis@@ comfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be conducted prior to the clinical evaluation by the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , a slight reduction in moderate hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent also observed in patients under sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or dual combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , a decrease in visual acu@@ ity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ cons , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , appearance or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report on distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological investigation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated fra@@ cture @-@ incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occ@@ ured at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this happens , treatment is to be reduced ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on drug interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one around 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in pregnancy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents across the tri@@ angles of the upper limit of the normal range also often appear to be similar to plac@@ ebo , but less rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an out@@ come study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ ides .
since the market launch has rarely been reported on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , which lasted for a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occ@@ ured at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy was continued for over two years in order to evaluate the time up to the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the therapy began , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients with gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been adequately adjusted with insulin despite three months of improvement was random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and a slight , yet clin@@ ically not significantly elevated levels of L@@ DL cholesterol were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized into groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one quickly res@@ or@@ bs , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness of the triple the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies it has been proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral application of radio@@ actively lab@@ eled pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the thread ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active metabol@@ ites are 16 @-@ 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys appeared in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in the gest@@ ation using Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) was induced by the ur@@ inary bladder .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use the insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar was set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lowered in a similar way as with another insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if they are administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the packaging supplement ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane weigh over the risks in the treatment of diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the transport of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar settings have improved significantly , for example , by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage required .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after changing animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used and used at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account the possible interactions with the therapy and ask patients to ask for other medications taken by them .

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the drug @-@ like ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europa@@ .eu
Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ pi@@ d may be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of fast @-@ acting insulin must first be wound up , followed by the amount of the long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d , this may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used and used at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site Gel@@ eg@@ osen - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of cryst@@ alline deposits including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atism ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the acid level is still higher than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur , which is why it is recommended that patients continue to use Aden@@ ur@@ ic for at least six months for the prevention of rheum@@ atism .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do medication ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol in 7@@ 62 patients each year .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood lay in the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took 120 mg once daily , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in lowering the level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also pose a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ inary deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently present pois@@ oning knot@@ s and / or g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the serum @-@ acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken on A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restrictions , the effectiveness and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ essing medicinal products , acute rheum@@ atism can occur during the course of the treatment , because the reduction of serum @-@ resin saw levels can initially mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues .
B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increases that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical studies , slight con@@ spic@@ u@@ ities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ .@@ Â &quot; s ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test prior to the commen@@ cement of the f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ec@@ tomy and subsequent course ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ war did not perform any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O in@@ hibition leads to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous dose of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( c@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without having a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study involving test subjects , 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x performed a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in c@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be attributed to side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ .@@ at pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
TI@@ ER@@ EX@@ PER@@ IM@@ ENT@@ AL studies do not include direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ute was observed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term follow @-@ up studies ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and were reported in all cases more than once were listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg treated .

mechanism of action ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ite in humans and arises in the context of the reaction cas@@ cade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is an effective , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro inhibit@@ ing , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
the efficacy of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month &apos;s serum per@@ ist@@ ration levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with serum breast cancer at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily and A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum levels of serum &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were consolidated for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the reduction of serum resin saw levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during a visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently kept over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum edi@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D ) .
A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum @-@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic concentrations in subjects regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ har@@ n@@ eic acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Et@@ wa 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients needed 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the toxic@@ ity of the g@@ out , which resulted in 54 % of the patients complete dis@@ appearance of the scores by month 24 .
increased SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects the maximum plasma concentrations ( c@@ max ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose propor@@ tionally increased .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after ing@@ es@@ tion of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the c@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,0 @-@ 5,3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum @-@ acid concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ Mark@@ ed F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at about 49 % of the dose found in the urine as imm@@ utable f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool found itself as unchanged F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and its con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient populations of kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the c@@ max of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average overall AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at took about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of ⋅ yr / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function at 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ yr / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with approximately the 11 @-@ fold exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions , such as 4.3 @-@ fold and with bearing ra@@ bb@@ its with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , have yiel@@ ded no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
21 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years were treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month &apos;s serum per@@ ist@@ ration levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients needed 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .

the owner of the permission for placing the drug has to make sure that a pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 Module 1.@@ 8.1 , is ready before the drug is put into circulation and is available as long as the medicine is put into circulation .
according to CH@@ MP gui@@ del@@ ine , an updated R@@ MP is to be submitted to risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plans or risk minim@@ ization activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( Pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) • on request of E@@ MEA
in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes insol@@ uble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the formation of the crystal is prevented and in this way a reduction of the symptoms can be achieved .
A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
inform your doctor before you start taking this drug if you have or had a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in consequence of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
if you have a rheum@@ atism at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat and joint swelling ) , wait until the attack is cleared before starting with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , in order to prevent an attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are using medications that may occur one of the following substances , since interactions with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may possibly consider necessary measures . • The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( to treat heart disease )
there have been no studies on the effects of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC on traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machines .
therefore , please contact your doctor first after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
on the back of the bli@@ ster pack the individual week@@ days are printed , so you can check if you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food .
if you have taken an inten@@ tional over@@ dose , contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital .
if you forgot to take A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , take it as soon as possible , unless the next dose is just before .
when you stop taking A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , your ur@@ ic acid concentration can increase again , and your dis@@ comfort can ag@@ grav@@ ate because new urine crystals can form in your joints and kid@@ neys as well as their surroundings .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data coming from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after 15 weeks of treatment , patients with low vitamin D levels were lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE equ@@ als the exact dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( stomach pain ) , tri@@ vial abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as sour upset .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients .
it should not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand tall or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. a permit for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following guidelines are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract other than p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ la@@ sty ( see Section 4.3 ) .
o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al correc@@ tions , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to any signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out , in the presence of symptoms of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation like dy@@ sp@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no increased risk was detected , the stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rare ( after market launch ) , some of them were severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regim@@ en administered mainly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available to indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a max@@ il@@ b@@ ular surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ os@@ rho@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the pill next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as planned at the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the intake of serum Cal@@ cium was up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ end@@ ron@@ at In@@ succession of oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ cholesterol to vitamin D3 .
the main effect of 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is the increase in the intestinal res@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum @-@ calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia and thus can lead to a higher risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

patients received AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in lower starch ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( n = 350 ) or Fos@@ am@@ ax ( al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ) 70 mg once a week ( n = 332 ) ; further vitamin D supplements were forbidden .
after 15 weeks of treatment the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at The therapeutic simil@@ arity of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once weekly 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was detected in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the fra@@ cture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : N = 6.@@ 45@@ 9 ) .
in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day compared with plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8,8 % in the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % on the drum .
in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % vs. Pla@@ z@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ user continued to remain ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , in which al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the application of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats revealed that al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue according to intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion According to an intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the threads .
according to an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system , and therefore it is not assumed that in humans it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through these transport systems .
res@@ or@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) following ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before recording a meal the middle area below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without considering endo@@ genous vitamin D3 levels ) .

advoc@@ acy is administered to adult patients who have a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ mmer are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ m@@ as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( by exam@@ ining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a re @-@ acquisition of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were carried out and examined how advoc@@ ate is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f .

in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other components , advoc@@ ate may not be applied .
patients and doctors need to be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with an an@@ agra@@ f , since the an@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medicine taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over @-@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulations and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or the regim@@ en should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a medical device experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ reflection conditions ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Progra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after switching .
on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ gra@@ ft phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with a low level of clearance , an adjustment of the an@@ agra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not allowed in the first post @-@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca .
immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained for the duration of the application to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ ent therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - change@@ over from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from two daily dosage of Progra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of an@@ agra@@ ph@@ s , so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to an@@ agra@@ ph@@ s a day , the recommended oral initi@@ als dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the gra@@ ft rejection must begin with the recommended oral initi@@ al@@ dose in the kidney and liver transplan@@ t .
heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients that are converted to an@@ agra@@ ph@@ s , an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patients , occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , with pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood tal@@ low in the targeted area , a reduction in the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in and monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in an individual case using full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king Control .
it is recommended to carry out frequent controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to advoc@@ acy , dose adjustment , alter@@ ation of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous application of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low level of clearance , adjusting the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the elevation of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts is usually between 5 - 20 ng / ml and in adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulations and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regim@@ en should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a medical device experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have been treated as therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation are still available .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents and transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents in childhood , no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation are still available .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided during treatment with adv@@ ent ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentration in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Progra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function problems , infections , liquid over@@ load and o@@ ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun @-@ protective agent with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms of PRE@@ S like headache , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . )
since advoc@@ ated hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ated , lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption are given special caution .
the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3 A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level while offering substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ 3 metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even more consistent levels ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction with anti@@ fung@@ al such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid @-@ antibiotic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or ; hence , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ aboli@@ zed by means of medicines which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduces the clearance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and thus can increase hor@@ m@@ onal exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when making decisions about contrac@@ eption measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially decrease the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not provide indications that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus a higher risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy exists .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ chain of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in desc@@ ending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

mode of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ enic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection within the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ h@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patients were transplan@@ ted to 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ as transplan@@ tation and in 630 patients were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 630 patients .
overall , the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies was consistent with observations in the major studies in which Progra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ ent@@ re study with oral Progra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases caused by bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8,0 % among C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients being converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45,@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33,@@ 3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group greater ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of the birth of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
pancre@@ as transplan@@ tation A multic@@ ent@@ re study with oral Progra@@ f was conducted on 205 patients who simultaneously received a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ tation , which received a random@@ ised procedure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then achieved to achieve the desired length of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts showed an actual survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ mination and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the Group &apos;s un@@ bound group of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a rein@@ forcement of the metabolism associated with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher levels of clearance observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ aboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly through the g@@ all .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Progra@@ f in stable patients treated with Progra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily intake .
it is recommended to carry out frequent controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have been treated as therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation are still available .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function problems , infections , liquid over@@ load and o@@ ede@@ ma .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent ha@@ emor@@ rh@@ ages in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in 86 % of 510 new blood cl@@ ots was awarded &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit to transport lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII , according to the location and extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the following here@@ mor@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients below 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , the recommended dose and frequency of injec@@ tions is recommended for controlling the dose and the frequency of injec@@ tions .
individual patients may differ in reaction to Factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ lives .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the dosage speed should be directed after the patient is found , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk being most important within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low@@ - ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s reported in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients showing higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ ke occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the Plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ OC in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) were observed after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ OC were treated with inhibit@@ ors against Factor VIII .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by exam@@ ining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell@@ ulose ; otherwise , there were no signs or symptoms referring to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ OC reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der responses ( frequency not known ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE safety profile , which makes it mandatory every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company res@@ umes its application for approval for the transport of Adv@@ ent to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bone or the tissue ( tissue that connects other structures in the body surro@@ unds and supports ) is affected .
this is a sort of virus that has been genetically altered in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene present in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ belly , bone and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still un@@ answered .
based on the test of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP opinion it was not proven that the injection of Adv@@ ant@@ ine in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has advantages for the patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over several hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are dis@@ closed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effectiveness was the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in exam@@ ining all hay fever symptoms besides con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose the patients reported a decrease of the symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared with 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , hyper@@ activity , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ oric hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary retention ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , or a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it should be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cutting , breaking or ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after a decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy in the case of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within the 2 weeks after such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , kle@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment in the case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
caution is recommended in the treatment of the following patient groups : • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions and can be reduced to their extent .
in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ oric test showed no significant differences between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol alone .
enzyme responsible for metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not result in increasing the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and on the basis of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of transport imper@@ me@@ ability or the ability to operate machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering processes .
headache , anxiety , complicated micro @-@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , exc@@ itation , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spi@@ ration , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il di@@ re and di@@ lat@@ ation , ery@@ thema , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include blocking the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including rein@@ forcement of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess was detected at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 248 patients between the ages of 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ am@@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show significant differences with regard to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
in the course of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the plasma dosing schedule .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was carried out as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , four subjects were found to be unable to metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( c@@ max and AU@@ C ) from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole treatment of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rin .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and ra@@ bb@@ its in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg per day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , Pharma@@ ko@@ vig@@ il@@ anz@@ systeme is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , and its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drinking or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for dispos@@ ing ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml mel@@ amine ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ ru@@ by and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged 1 to 5 years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ ru@@ ps .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ ru@@ ps .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was studied in eight trials involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the no@@ des , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the syrup , solution for inser@@ ting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US led to an average decrease in symptom scores ( symptom number ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the placing of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out in accordance with the previous disease process and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been termin@@ ated and res@@ um@@ ed upon recur@@ rence .
per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine tablets , in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while consuming A@@ ER@@ I@@ US and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impair@@ ment of traffic jams or the ability to operate machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported on more often than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes blocking the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the adhesive molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of Q@@ t@@ c interval demonstrated .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including rein@@ forcement of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology despite the eti@@ ology of different forms is similar and chronic patients can be retro@@ actively recru@@ ited .
since hist@@ am@@ ination is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also leading to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical gui@@ del@@ ine .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study similar to the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of the patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with a des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , rich breakfast ) did not cooperate on the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative variation in the toxic@@ ity profile of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ ER@@ I@@ US can be taken regardless of meals , to relieve symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine constra@@ ined and experience higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metabol@@ ise .
this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in the context of clinical studies with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets , where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US syrup group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , which were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ea dose of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets in adults and adolescents carried out no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ oric in clinical studies .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor increase dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

the spread of this fully met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the syrup @-@ formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis that can be met@@ aboli@@ zed .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the c@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation following once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and c@@ max values were comparable to pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients in the recommended doses , with those of adults who received the meth@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which is met@@ aboli@@ zed , is identical to that in children who are normally met@@ aboli@@ zing .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study at a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged 6 to 11 years .
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and , alternatively , in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis .
as demonstrated by the overall results of the questionn@@ aire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .

June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. formally announced that the company ref@@ uses its application for approval for the placing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect from a strain of the flu virus which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
an influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges that can easily spread from man to man because human beings have not yet built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
when the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to form a fast antibody in a contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , was att@@ un@@ ed and used as an ingredient of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in taking part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ cer@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
generic medicine should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has been judged that the virus is directed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 m@@ g. of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs are taken .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of asp@@ ir@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , as@@ generic medicine reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS not cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase with low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors earlier .
the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but as@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors very few responded to the treatment .
in the study of adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine induced by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r lowered the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
generic medicine may also not be used in patients , the Johannis@@ k@@ raut ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are just as well as asp@@ ir@@ as and are harmful to the blood in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune response syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have out@@ weigh@@ ed the risks for over four years .
generic A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic de@@ composition Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee confirmed that the benefit of am@@ using in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally supposed to be under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing an@@ x@@ ie@@ ties across the European Union .
generic drugs are used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
usually , A@@ generic Cap@@ sules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic Boo@@ ster@@ y of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r should be administered together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r should be done taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution for weight loss is 14 % lower than of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , as@@ cer@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcement of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of asp@@ ir@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a day @-@ maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
generic medicine may not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with asp@@ ir@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be used along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and supp@@ res@@ sive adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under international norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , as@@ cer@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ cep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to be administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl@@ gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
a rash should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with medications that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ arthritis are reported .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic latitude may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width azi@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the low plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the blood sugar level and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
increased for c@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were applied twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for the use of ag@@ nos@@ ine was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the an@@ ta@@ sia component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adjustment is not necessary .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may reduce the serum concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines are to be used at the same time , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
when used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
the simultaneous dose of amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with ag@@ nos@@ ine , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with azi@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the c@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 10 ) compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of fossi@@ ls with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may result in drug interactions , if used together with ag@@ ul@@ ase .
therefore , patients should be monitored for toxic reactions related to these medicines if they are used in combination with ag@@ nos@@ sis .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as an as@@ cer@@ ase , as it can lead to res@@ or@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va known as an enzy@@ matic duc@@ tor ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a decrease in the plasma level of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ cardi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by means of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
simultaneous consumption with ag@@ gra@@ sis can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side @-@ effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dose of am@@ using with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma concentrations are expected at the same time .
since plasma @-@ level increases in these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while offering amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while cau@@ ti@@ ously with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am , it is advisable to use par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored at op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to be administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation as to how the Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adjusted when Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with ag@@ nos@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended as a simultaneous gift of ag@@ gra@@ sis ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ ing rats , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the arm@@ or in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight in the offspring during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
as@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are in connection with the intake of as@@ cer@@ ase or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory alter@@ ations occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation ( stit@@ ching ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals treated with amp@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( st@@ acks ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study performed in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ately distinctive , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular @-@ like nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r had to be ab@@ orted .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary support measures .
amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral g@@ ag and g@@ ag pol@@ - poly@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concent@@ rating ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ro@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
in six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ V , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : N = 107 ) patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic testing systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance to the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resist@@ ence ) .
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ ls of resistance to resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ) , the resistance path@@ way associated with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a failing treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open trial that received PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ gu@@ ine ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r relative to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in relation to the time @-@ adjusted average variable ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ blocked asp@@ ir@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20@@ mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 B@@ ased on these data , the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asp@@ ir@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be taken into consideration when optimi@@ zing the therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
increased for c@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attributed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the steam state via the range of c@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution when they are administered with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is a 14 % less bio@@ available solution than from the capsules . therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution and ase @-@ free capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a single milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day without a simultaneous dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals with dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mice lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the controls and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma expos@@ ures , which were significantly lower ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus jug@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcement of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of asp@@ ir@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a day @-@ maximum dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction . they are contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under international norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
a rash should be set to 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
increased for c@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were reached twice daily with the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
when used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed , as a precise predi@@ ction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administ@@ er ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with ag@@ nos@@ ine , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dosage is 31 , although no clinical data is available .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ cardi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate plasma levels increased significantly while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with ag@@ nos@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alized R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of orth@@ o @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the arm@@ or in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased body weight in the offspring during the lac@@ tation period .
as@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary support measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concent@@ rating ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , therapy optimisation should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation involving PI pre @-@ treated children .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the steam state via the range of c@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered with caution when they are administered with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al function impair@@ ment should be low on the elimination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals with dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings .

studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the controls and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolism path@@ ways are not yet fully developed , so that Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z )
it is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for recording was not covered with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution for weight loss is 14 % lower than of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r than capsule ; therefore , as@@ cer@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to take away ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for the A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a day @-@ maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for weight loss and low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment is not deemed necessary for Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl@@ engl@@ y@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous dosing can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of drug metabolism and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with asp@@ ir@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under international norm@@ alised ratio ) , methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with disease @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ arthritis are reported .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
increased for c@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r Cap@@ sules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with ag@@ gra@@ sis can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and result in side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . due to the possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us it may not be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ ing rats , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight in the offspring .
as@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are in connection with the intake of as@@ cer@@ ase or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ro@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .

application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • With acute ker@@ at@@ oses , it is repeated five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time the cream is thin layer on the affected skin surfaces , so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo reported either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete response rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before going to bed and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible wr@@ inkl@@ es have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ od@@ ont@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she not@@ ices it and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the clean@@ sed , ti@@ ghtly infected skin area until the cream is fully covered .
it should be considered in these patients between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
in these patients it should take place between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with one for circumc@@ ision were observed .
in an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty in ur@@ ination , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applications used to treat external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ od@@ ont@@ al areas , no clinical experience has yet to be found .
limited data ad@@ mitt@@ edly indicates an increased rate of incl@@ ination reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown in this patient group regarding the elimination of bid war@@ ts , however , a lesser effectiveness .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair attachment was not examined .
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
after the treatment of the treated skin , the clinical outcome of the therapy can be evaluated for approximately 12 weeks after the treatment is finished .
as there is currently no data on long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is present in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) there is a lower probability of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ se .
only very limited data about the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause serious dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions reduced a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were not quanti@@ fiable after a unique top@@ ical application ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most common adverse events that were shared and likely or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the trials with three weeks of weekly treatment were local reactions in the area of treatment of ti@@ lt ni@@ p@@ ples ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and likely or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects were a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the adverse events reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
the clinical signs prescribed according to the study diagram show that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three weeks of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / sc@@ rolling ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) occurred ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the study plan , the clinical signs prescribed by the study show that five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream was very common to severe ery@@ them@@ ic subjects ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe shr@@ ink@@ age and ruin ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies evalu@@ ating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy studies have shown that the efficacy in the treatment of leg war@@ ts is significantly superior in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od the F@@ lt war@@ ts were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a 25 cm2 large treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external fly@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma typically do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
minimal systematic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were treated in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able pou@@ ch ) , scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application was low on MC @-@ affected skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to those with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg were significantly reduced body weight and increased lac@@ tic weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application gave no similar effects to the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days per week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours on the site .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for humans due to systemic exposure can be regarded as very low .
tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R .

al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and therefore accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the moti@@ ons more difficult , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a physician who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with res@@ us@@ c@@ itation devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but it also measured its effectiveness ( by exam@@ ining its effect in reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children demonstrated a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the inf@@ usion point .
frequent side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be dis@@ closed every year and where necessary update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will monitor patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in regards to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ sters O@@ vary , chin@@ ese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where res@@ us@@ c@@ itation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding res@@ um@@ ption of the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously prec@@ eded .
60 minutes before beginning inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to treat the potential incidence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ted and / or reduction of the inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
inf@@ usion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction in the inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .

al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular up@@ take of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase consists .

since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical studies were primarily classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the phase 3 study and pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over for a duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , air@@ still@@ s and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with a predominantly severe form of treatment and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients experienced a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe follow @-@ up form usually within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until premature ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , patients with 13 / 45 were not present by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ recip@@ itation ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels had a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while a variable decrease of G@@ AG in the urine was observed in patients with high antibody levels .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enzy@@ matic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reas@@ oning for enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient re@@ establishment of enzy@@ matic activity .
after IV inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of the patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be treated in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as indicated in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung capacity increased propor@@ tionally to the height of adults of adults .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was detected in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease of the disease between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , clin@@ ically significant changes were summar@@ ized for five efficiency variables ( expected percentage of patients with 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ open phase 2 study was conducted , in which Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me &apos;s safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg during the last 26 weeks due to increased g@@ ag@@ ine levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe follow @-@ up form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity of one @-@ time dose , toxic@@ ity in repeated treatment and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot identify any particular haz@@ ards for humans .

in patients suffering from M@@ PS I lies an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
in case of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with other medicines please inform your doctor if you use drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
handling - di@@ lu@@ tion and application The concentrate for the preparation of an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - un@@ conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , air@@ still@@ s and facial oils .

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me inf@@ usion ( with as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • For the body weight of each patient first determine the number of bottles to be dil@@ uted .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer medicines ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole treatment in patients who have not yet been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapy .
to decrease side effects , patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional anti @-@ em@@ etic medicine ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given .
in patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postpon@@ ed , de@@ composed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slo@@ ws down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form enters into cancer cells more easily than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 45@@ 6 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin out@@ lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ium cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed prolonged survival rates than with the compar@@ ative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for placing A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4,2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml further ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with low @-@ K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( K@@ OF ) administered intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of K@@ OF as an inf@@ usion about a period of 2 hours after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF administ@@ ers intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift and on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) a week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood image should be created prior to each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , dose testing must take place under consideration of the ne@@ adi@@ r of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the pre@@ valent therapeutic cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 that can be used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA needs to be ab@@ orted if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ers a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort scale 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , there is an increased side effect risk in patients aged 65 years or older .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary for dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper B@@ ili@@ ft limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in the studies .
patients must be supervised in terms of bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ c@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te numbers and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ chth@@ on@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia has been observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be treated to treat fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ational anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tical ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients receiving treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular space .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out prior to the treatment of the treatment to obtain advice concerning the preservation of sperm .
high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can lead to reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion in patients with normal kidney function ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) .
therefore , caution is advisable when used in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed are avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy necess@@ it@@ ates an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy except where mandatory and after careful balancing of use for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be pointed out prior to the treatment beginning to obtain couns@@ elling regarding semen volume .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in breast@@ fed inf@@ ants cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and that were random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who received random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was specified in relation to the inclusion of all events where the report doctor held a connection with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients random@@ ised P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed included su@@ pra@@ vent@@ ri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the Phase 2 results of three P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ enia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in the alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who received random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed and 830 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC , which received random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident and trans@@ it@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported occasionally in kl@@ ini@@ - studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) .
in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment occasionally cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
it has been reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which exer@@ ts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .

EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ ent@@ re , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind phase 3 study by ALI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in low @-@ grade ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , showed that with ALI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated patients had clin@@ ically significant advantage of a survival in medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ months compared to those patients who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural hearing loss was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 212 patients ) in relation to the sole c@@ is@@ pl@@ a @-@ tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the difference between the two arms was improved by improving the lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ ent@@ re , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy showed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival fell in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed are similar for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination vis @-@ à @-@ vis gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in accordance with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Continu@@ ous interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ loss limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fusion ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) and plat@@ el@@ et transactions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ ie@@ tin ( 10,@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 6.8 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed after injection as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usions for a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours after application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney fun@@ dus ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study of Be@@ agle dogs that had received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us injec@@ tions for 9 months , tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( de@@ gen@@ e- ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epithel@@ ial tissue ) .
unless otherwise used , the storage times and conditions after the preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lu@@ tion has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
dissolve the contents of the 100 mg penetration bottles with 4,2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the product quality .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
23 heavy cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the sample .
it is applied to obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and after 12 weeks have no weight loss , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the diet , which causes about a quarter of the fats that are fed with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i compared 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who participated alone had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches at anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bow@@ el movement , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ iness , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( strings ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ li@@ stat G@@ SK in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a lightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 , as there is not enough data for efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ li@@ stat is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , it is not necessary to adapt the dosage to elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• intoler@@ ance to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic col@@ li@@ zation syndrome • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ rich single meal or low @-@ fat diet .
since the reduction in weight in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dose of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregn@@ an@@ cies in order to prevent possible failure of oral contra@@ cep@@ ts in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with con@@ current use of or@@ li@@ stat and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants combined with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally standardized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ li@@ stat for up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparations before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ li@@ stat at the same time , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed .
TI@@ ER@@ EX@@ PER@@ IM@@ ENT@@ AL studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects detected after the market launch of or@@ li@@ stat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ li@@ stat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after market launch of or@@ li@@ stat over@@ dose , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ li@@ stat .
based on human and animal studies , a quick recovery of possible systemic effects caused by or@@ li@@ stat &apos;s li@@ pas@@ ing properties can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect occurs in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bon@@ ding to the active ser@@ ine rest of ga@@ str@@ an and pancre@@ atic drops .
from clinical studies , 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat was taken three times a day , blocking absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average temperature in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ li@@ stat were not measur@@ able 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ li@@ stat ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ li@@ stat in the plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients , which was administered to a minimal systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites ( M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ mol@@ yl@@ leu@@ cine group ) were identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the mentioned side effects you significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise diet @-@ related side effects : • Begin almost a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat main dish or a substantial dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight loss . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not apply any more than 25 ° C after the ex@@ piration date indicated on the carton . • Ke@@ ep ti@@ ghtly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them . • You can carry your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is included in this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases , such as : • Blu@@ th@@ och@@ rome • Diabetes • Heart Disease • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis
lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
the quantity for you is the information below , which indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with the recommended fat supply is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss while reducing the lik@@ eli@@ hood of diet @-@ related side effects . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight about 0.5 kil@@ ograms per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not walk daily , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Middle physical activity &quot; means that you burn 150 kcal per day , e.g. by 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minute gar@@ dening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and keep them in . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional diary with information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before starting all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on cal@@ orie and fat @-@ induced nutrition and give guidelines to becoming more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type of weight loss program , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
al@@ op@@ eci@@ a is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate tri@@ ggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the pot@@ ency of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the addition of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic medicine ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information about the effects of this age group .
this means that the active ingredient is binding a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to inhi@@ bit the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate sol@@ vers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ eci@@ a showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy , which is moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ op@@ eci@@ a showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted its approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of a cancer condition and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ op@@ eci@@ a for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a te@@ di@@ ous i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required in con@@ current administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where Q@@ t interval is prolonged or which tend to be such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy treatment Alo@@ xi will not be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics directed against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ Stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ ms , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous dose of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences on the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not pre@@ valent , therefore , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
clinical trials were the most common adverse events at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing testimon@@ ials .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events like in the other dosage groups showed themselves ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective treatment for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time of 7.2 hours ) that was given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received much em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously in day 1 .
results of trials with moderate @-@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials evalu@@ ating chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( c@@ max ) and the area below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ ed proportion@@ ately in the overall dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to an intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % was observed between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron achieved total exposure to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg was comparable ; however , the c@@ max was higher after gran@@ ting 0.75 mg .
about 40 % of the kid@@ neys are eliminated and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the amino acid enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination of an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was found around 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous injection in healthy eyes the overall length of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
while patients with severe liver dysfunction have increased the termin@@ ale elimination period and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified by this .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which suggests a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From pre@@ clinical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to 30 @-@ fold the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al disease ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low as for humans .
the European Commission must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the placing of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same dentist element that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; Reference In@@ sur@@ fers &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a microsc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme alan@@ ine amine @-@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which stimulates this for the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data which substanti@@ ate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided by the CH@@ MP to prohi@@ bit approval for placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns were expressed in the absence of data on the stability of the drug and the pharmaceuticals market .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after adjusting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease fl@@ ared up again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study was to investigate the extent to which the medi@@ cam@@ ent dis@@ sol@@ ves an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ ings ( cra@@ cks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
al@@ ar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were det@@ ectable or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ lin@@ ic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this kind of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial stra@@ ins ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the treatment ended .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under@@ went treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together on skin wounds , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by MRI .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is irrit@@ ation at the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks associated with short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mary , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go on the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment should be ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected position .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations found in people after top@@ ical use on isolated skin or infected surface wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and c@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on a dimin@@ ished skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to systemic antibiotics .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / termin@@ ated , it is advisable to weigh the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go had applied , the most common reported side effect was Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the administration site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial reef , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggest that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ center .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , blocking partial P @-@ bind interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if on the basis of the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some types of infection appears question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study of healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily by oc@@ cl@@ usion to intact and s@@ lan@@ ted skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medi@@ ation and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 cm2 effective skin ( c@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , with low involvement of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid canc@@ ers .
in vitro studies on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro @-@ nucle@@ us test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 cm2 of abra@@ ded skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were determined in oral dos@@ ages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed killing ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ ani is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged 1 to 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases .
in the context of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , Ambi@@ rix will be administered as part of a second dose of protection against hepatitis B .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the existing vacc@@ ination plan can be carried out from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is required for hepatitis A or B , ambi@@ x or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines act by helping the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies against it .
ambient rix includes the same components as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose @-@ existing vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ ani and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two injec@@ tions .
in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentration against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ ani was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ ani ( observed in more than 1 of 10 doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ ani may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals S.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix all over the world .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan for pri@@ ori@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent people who have responded to a Hepatitis A vaccine need a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standar@@ dis@@ ing scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibody is achieved after the pri@@ me@@ val process , so that in these cases the application of further vacc@@ ines may be required .
since an intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal im@@ pedi@@ ment , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
however , in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting distur@@ ban@@ ces , however , ambient temperature can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can come to ble@@ edings after intra@@ muscular treatment .
if Ambi@@ ani was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps ro@@ cking vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ eness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ ular and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of Ambi@@ ani were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and thickness on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects , compared with 39.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the test persons vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of stiff@@ ness was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the test persons who received the Ambi@@ rix level compared to 36.@@ 2 % in subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and stiff@@ ness was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3 @-@ dose regim@@ en .
in a comparison study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ani a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ ani or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- units as a combination vaccine infected hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines aged 1 to including 15 years , the serum levels for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was disc@@ ord@@ able , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the V@@ acc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme with an ambi@@ x or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12 to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ Bs @-@ antibodies was shown 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to the in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ ia and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps ri@@ ot vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined for any foreign particles and / or physically visible alter@@ ations , both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state of charge is granted by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ent waters .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect from infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines , ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ ani or any ingredient of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child already have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has / has .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a viral hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ enses / is or if you / your child under@@ goes a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient , so a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 . tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines ( including those that you have received without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has received / has received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given to ambient temperature at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible .
if ambient temperature is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
typically , pregnant or breast@@ feeding women are not administered unless they are vacc@@ inated against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ ani Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 imp@@ aired cans ) : • pain or dis@@ comfort at the pier@@ cing point or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 imp@@ aired cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Dep@@ ending • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal symptoms
other side effects reported in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 p@@ enn@@ ed doses ) are reported :
these include locally limited or extensive r@@ ashes that can it@@ chy or be bub@@ bles , swelling of the eye area and facial , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and loss of consciousness .

23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the mentioned side effects you / your child has significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that have been known since the initial approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP reported that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ani remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ ani has only been put into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study since ammon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without drug ) .
Amm@@ on@@ aps can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , taste disorders or flavor version , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle were effectively prevented from high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amm@@ on@@ aps was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under exceptional circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval , only limited information about this drug has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete lack of enzyme already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , manifest@@ ed after the first month of life ) , an indication of the use occurs when the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis consists of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein toler@@ ances and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ amide syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ in@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should get ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk for the formation of o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as associated with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate occurs over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it resulted in slo@@ wing the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in 56 % of patients in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS at least one adverse event occurred ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to be associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery oc@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during IV administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg per day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound which is jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys via acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with on@@ set of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was previously almost always inf@@ aust , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
through ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first life month ) of diagnosed diseases to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ ep@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were re@@ covering from a hyper@@ active enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and afterwards treated persist@@ ently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in the liver and kid@@ neys with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after injection of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following iv administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl concentrate were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with u@@ rea cycle problems or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys within 24 hours of about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rat had no concl@@ usive effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ amide syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ cot@@ in@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules contain 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl ) , les@@ ions were found in the py@@ rami@@ ds of the brain bark .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery oc@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus acid
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl concentrate were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during shelf life , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS may be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if you undertake laboratory tests , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , dis@@ appearance of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were also observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance in case of un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest of different thick@@ nesses ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in the sole dose or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients receiving a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other brain cells or one of the other ingredients .
it must also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox &apos;s placing in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous diameter of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another row , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion should be increased for the duration of the procedure to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , dosage of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately following intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and efficacy of an all @-@ in Bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended , even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ tive and dil@@ uted medicine should be mixed carefully before the application and the bol@@ us dose is quickly given intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restrictions ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0,3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose is checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us was administered without dose adjustment at an average of 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• serious hyper@@ tension and / or ir@@ reversible distur@@ ban@@ ces due to distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible distur@@ ban@@ ces . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even though , in case of PCI patients suffering from bi@@ val@@ or@@ u@@ din most ble@@ edings on arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points can occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during treatment in principle bleeding can occur .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is again attained before the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors ) it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ear@@ u@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding such as table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ ali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area requiring radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed ha@@ emor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ ear@@ u@@ din in 6,000 patients who have submitted a PCI .
in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects that are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din is immediately interrupted and the patient is closely monitoring with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion bin@@ der region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of bic@@ u@@ ir@@ u@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because thro@@ mb@@ in its part slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ine .
in addition , using serum from patients with serum @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) had not indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out below , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the procedure increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , untreated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered according to the relevant guidelines for treating acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ inc@@ ision inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly across the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went an@@ gi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or administered as permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or unable to process the insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter mode of operation than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
A@@ pi@@ dra cans may have to be modified when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of abdominal s@@ acks .
due to decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs in patients with a restriction of liver function may be reduced .
any change in the mode of action , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ arded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may undergo a change in the insulin requirement .
3 A inadequate dosage or dis@@ continuation of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin to another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of the occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etic drugs , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ rami@@ des , fi@@ bre@@ ates , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c regulation should be weakened or absent .
TI@@ ER@@ EX@@ PER@@ IM@@ ENT@@ AL studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity did not show any differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not exceed the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application .
listed below are the adverse drug releases known from clinical studies group@@ ed by system organ classes and ordered according to the decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data not estimated ) .

li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ic injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male patients aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a proportional amount of glucose @-@ lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional rise in the glu@@ cos@@ ic effect , just like insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
after serving insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is applied 15 minutes after the meal begins , a similar gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human normal insulin which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
