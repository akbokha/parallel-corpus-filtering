<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the packaging supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melamine tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thoughts and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not available), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disturbance, a mental disorder where patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) with periods of normal temperament.</seg>
<seg id="6">ABILIFY is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution for inserting or the fusion tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, as well as ABILIFY, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," meaning chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol is like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three trials of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that were suffering from increased anxiety, compared over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of ABILIFY injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased anxiety, compared with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo for a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly greater in reducing symptoms than those who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In applying to the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased more effectively in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, ABILIFY prevented up to 74 weeks of effective placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">ABILIFY injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrollable sugar), tremor (fatigue), somnolence (nausea), salivation (drowsiness), fatigue and fatigue, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Drugs (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of ABILIFY in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disturbances as well as in preventing a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes were outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in the quick control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for placing ABILIFY across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes approached the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increase in efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiologic study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated suicide risk associated with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acocelised and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, consideration should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients who were treated with Aripiprazole an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, resp. an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is needed if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107% while the cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects, and similar can reductions should therefore be undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy due to insufficient data conditions for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, patients with Aripiprazole treated a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients treated with gloss apin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients with Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those with lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was measured for patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">There was no medically significant difference between the patient groups using Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were observed.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing because Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disturbance is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine di2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine di2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients with response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate showed significantly greater improvement than Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks on stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal 'weight gain' was significant fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed an efficacy compared to placebo in week 3 and a reduction effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part lasted over 2 weeks not on lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum lenses, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior efficacy in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had reached a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazol was superior to the prevention of a bipolar backfall, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxymodelling of Aripiprazol, which is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole on extensive metabolisers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as did a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenia.</seg>
<seg id="91">A single-specific analysis for pharmacokinetics revealed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and canzerogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent secondary kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates from Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazole were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the Gall of monkeys in 39 weeks and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3 and 11 times of the average steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase resorption and minimize the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under bypassing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or acutely therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">In case a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the features of the medicine for Abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or ABILIFY solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with intoxicity and behavioural disorders, which have been otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed in terms of extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acocelised and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a mns are high fever, stiffness, alternating levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">However, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy volunteers used Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) as a single-piece intramuscularly and the simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2-antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' ('poor') metabolisers, compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the beginning of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 lauazepam (2 mg dose) received intramuscularly, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials using Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18,2% was measured for patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">There was no medically significant difference between the patient groups using Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters were observed.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agidity and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant greater improvement in the symptoms of ascertaining and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed medium bettering from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score for the primary 2-hour end point was 5,8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on decreased number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients with response to study medication were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (orally) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate showed significantly greater improvement than Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks on stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher response rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal 'weight gain' was significant fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part lasted over 2 weeks not on lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum lenses, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior efficacy in the reduction of manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study of study in manic patients who had reached a remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazol was superior to the prevention of a bipolar backfall, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection the AUC after applying the same dose as a tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In two studies with healthy volunteers, the average time was applied to the maximum plasma level for 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which were between 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on the reproductive toxicity following IV application, no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure were observed, which lay in 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and canzerogenic potential, the preclinical data could not identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent secondary kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3-10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates from Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3 and 11 times of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters previously had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole dose or monotherapy) was compared with the medicine contained in a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to the worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It should also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Medicines (CHMP) found that in patients with whom the first treatment no longer suggests more effective than conventional paclitaxel, it was not necessary to use other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxian BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where first-line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In case of sensory neuropathy grade 3 treatment is to be interrupted, until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2, and with all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies were conducted with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an Albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which may have substantially other pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophl number is increased again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number is increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly indicated cardio-toxicity was not proven with abnormalities, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with early anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the patient receives nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the treatment of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constipating remedies.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, which do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane will be advised to produce no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should consult a sperm-conservation before treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (frequent), which can affect the transport tightness and ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal phase III clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of the patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, increase in weight, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart diseases:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dyspagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, joint pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active substance that promotes the composition of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin transforms the transittosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and has been proven in in-vitro studies that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminate receptor and due to the albumin protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxanes for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unlinked studies and of 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received treatment with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for preventing an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had an impaired overall condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; first line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity vs. paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural progression of peripheral neuropathy to the sound of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30 and 180 minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure Exposure (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analog to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to an intravenous dose of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or tissue bandaging of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of paclitaxel was higher at Abraxane-Gabe (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue histopathology, paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel, suggesting a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, there are only a few data available to patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, be careful when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile injection, it is slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution into a Abraxane pass bottle.</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete addition of the solution, the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be swivelled slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inverted until a complete full board of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If any precipitation or sinking is visible, the water bottle must be gently inverted in order to achieve complete resusability prior to application.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that has already been approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "Reference Insurfers").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood fertilisation which may occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, in case a blood-blood donor is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection may also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be monitored before treatment to ensure that iron deficiency is not an iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency, or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) has been inserted, which enables them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to a vein as an injection in a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients who suffered anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected for at least eight weeks Eprex / Erypo in a vein before they either switched to abseamed or still received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator for effectiveness was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abseamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were switched to abseamed were maintained in the same measure as with those who still received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally cause symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headache and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for abseamed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union, proof has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG to approve the launch of Abseamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiplem myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in the case of planned larger surgery procedures which require a large blood volume rate (4 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be used in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot take part in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and complications may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability of patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose needed for control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Initial dosage 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with an increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for control of the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocyte value &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte count increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl three times a week, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retikulocyte number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood containment is required, should be given at a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation programme begins, so that large iron reserves are available prior to the start of the subroutine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days before, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythrocystipia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a seamed or other erythropoietin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients envisaged for a greater elective orthopaedic surgery and which cannot take part in an autologous blood donation program, the use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying disease: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythrocystipenia (PRCA) Very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody-dispersed PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of efficacy, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Retikulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of non-responding (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the Retikulocytes "index"), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be weighted to the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous application of Abseamed in patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration recommended under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the application of epoetines when the concentration of haemoglobin is increased by the concentration required to control anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should not exceed 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestion, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration recommended under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet a dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should consider a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-Gabe and erythropoetin response (patients that need to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb rise is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of Patients with chemotherapeutic anaemia - Dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision for the application of recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients envisaged for a greater elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, particularly in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of post-thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins did not prove that they could improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a hemoglobin target concentration was targeted from 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">When epoetin alfa is applied together with Ciclosporin, the blood level of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose should be adjusted to the increasing hematocrite.</seg>
<seg id="429">From in-vitro studies on tumour tissues there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in relation to hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, aneurysm, retinal arthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetinen.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropogratin treatment it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="580">Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledron acid or other bisphosphonates or other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonate patients, Aclasta is subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the Infusion Body and osteonecrose (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta is providing information material for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as the use of medicines for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The packaging supplement • contraindication in pregnancy and lactating women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fractures (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently undergone low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta may be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see Section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended, as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and young people of Aclasta are not recommended for children and young people under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of the treatment with Aclasta. (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">A temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is advisable to provide adequate intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bisphosphonate treatments with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental surgery, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonate decreases the risk of osteopathy in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta may be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of atrial fibrillation reported in cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to those who received placebo (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoledronyric acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which expressed itself as a decrease in renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited renal function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after application was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2,10 mmol / l) occurred in patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus-Paget study.</seg>
<seg id="614">In addition, all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fractures and in the Morbus-Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently suffered hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronylic acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonectomy in the jaw area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which have been treated with bisphosphonate, including zinc-cleic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports relate to cancer patients by tooth extraction or other dental operations.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteonecrose in the orthodontic area of a patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of overdosing, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -1,5 and at least two light or a medium-severe existing spine figure ≤ -2,5 with or without signs of an existing spine survey.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures in Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years, resulting in reduced risk of hip fractures in one reduced by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at the lumbar vertebra, hips and distal radius compared to placebo-treatment significantly at all time points (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increasing the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the overall waist by 6.0%, the chenkelhal by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology For 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies were taken out of the pelvic membrane.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptide (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg Aclasta inhibited BSAP after 12 months significantly reduced by 30% compared to the baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but majority of patients received an initial intake of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, Aclasta-treatment increased compared to placebo-treatment BMD at all time points.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta-Treatment conducted over 24 months compared to placebo for an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% of the threshold.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once daily administration of Aclasta compared to the once weekly dose of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 with radiologically verified, mainly mild to moderate morbus pasting of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to 2.6fold up to 3.0fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg citric acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg risedronat once a day during 2 months was proved in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month main study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response in 141 patients treated with Aclasta was treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 patients treated with risedronate in an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and more than 5 and 15 minute persistent infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rapidly increased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large circulation with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a prolonged period of elimination with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above-mentioned t ½ -values) probably represent the quick absorption into the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zinc acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the bend (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized by humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in 64 examined patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function problem down to a creatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the oledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney function disturbance (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0,6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In trials on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influencing.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In trials involving intravenous use was administered the renal tolerability of Zoledron acid in rats, administered as a 15-minute infusion of 0.25 mg / kg, administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose which corresponds to 7times the human-therapeutic exposure, related to AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as on the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common infection with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyse of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses, an infestation that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats a teratogenicity in dosages decreased from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum levels of serum.</seg>

<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, mainly oestrogens formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is structured uniformly, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing bone structure, ensuring normal bone formation and thus restoring strength to the bone.</seg>

<seg id="730">In a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes (SERENADE), absolute change in the HbA1c value (with an initial value of 7.9% for both groups) after 6 months -0.8 for Rimonabant 20 mg and -0.3 under Placebo</seg>
<seg id="731">The percentage of patients who reached HbA1c- value of &lt; 7% was 51% in the Rimonabant group and 35% in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="732">The difference in the middle weight ratio between the 20 MGs and the placebo group was 3.8 kg (CI95% -5,0, -2.6 p &lt; 0.001). LN</seg>
<seg id="733">Improvement of the HbA1c value in patients who had taken Rimonabant 20 mg were about 50% due to direct effects of Rimonabant and about 50% explained by weight reduction.</seg>
<seg id="734">The steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days (cmax = 196 ± 28,1 ng / ml; Ctrough = 91,6 ± 14.1 ng / ml; AUC0-24 = 2960 ± 268 ng.h / ml).</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR to the public. this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated. • It can be applied together with another diabetes drug (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can also be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which cannot be satisfactorily set with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylun or insulin may be maintained with the beginning of the acetone treatment except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of actos was examined in tripletherapy; in doing so, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos lead to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced by applying the dosage of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional application of actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea in a lowering of HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the addition of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin showed a reduction in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoaesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic ketoacidosis (high testosterone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos as part of a monotherapy (for sole use) should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for placing actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marker "15" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. premature cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with higher output liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased to 3-fold the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal discomfort, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazone should be conducted prior to the clinical evaluation by the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven, which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a slight reduction in moderate hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent also observed in patients under sulfonylurea and insulin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or dual combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazolid indicons, including pioglitazone, appearance or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema if patients report on disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological investigation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occured at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this happens, treatment is to be reduced (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on drug interactions have shown that pioglitazone does not affect pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance in pregnancy with Pioglitazone, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone ALT ascents across the triangles of the upper limit of the normal range also often appear to be similar to placebo, but less rarely than in comparative groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than in placebo when Pioglitazone resides.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch has rarely been reported on congestive heart failure under Pioglitazone, however, when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone treated groups and more than 7,400 patients treated with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study, which lasted for a period of 3.5 years, fractures occured at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ), leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy was continued for over two years in order to evaluate the time up to the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the therapy began, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients with gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had been adequately adjusted with insulin despite three months of improvement was randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45%, compared with the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Creatinine quotient showed a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Creatinine quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and a slight, yet clinically not significantly elevated levels of LDL cholesterol were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while lower values were observed under metformin and gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglyceride levels but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone quickly resorbs, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered Pioglitazone in the plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to the effectiveness of the triple the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies it has been proven that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively labeled pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the thread (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unaltered Pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and all active metabolites are 16-23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys appeared in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction of hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance in the gestation using Pioglitazone, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) was induced by the urinary bladder.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindicons led to an increased frequency of colontal tumours.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marker "30" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture-incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occured at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazone or gliclazide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Creatinine quotient showed a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Creatinine quotient compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the Nüchtern triglyceride levels but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on the tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic trypceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study had missed the goal of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-mortal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary vascularization and vascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone there are no cardiovascular long-term risks associated with.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone and of more than 7,400 patients receiving comparative medication, there was an increased incidence of bone fractures in women.</seg>

<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test prior to the commencement of the febuxostatectomy and subsequent course (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwar did not perform any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that XO inhibition leads to a rise in theophylline mirror (a hibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous dose of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in febuxostature exposure (cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / indometacin / hydrochloroazide / warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with colchicin or indometacin without having a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient required at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving test subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x performed a mean 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that simultaneous consumption of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide, the absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) delayed and a decrease in cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC causes.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies cannot be attributed to side effects of Febux.at pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>

<seg id="1219">ADENURIC was the primary efficacy endpoint of 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum-harnacidic concentrations in subjects regardless of their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum-harneic acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks, so that less than 3% of patients needed 16-24 treatment against a gout (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the toxicity of the gout, which resulted in 54% of the patients complete disappearance of the scores by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased SH- values (&gt; 5.5 µg / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects the maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat by administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportionally increased.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After ingestion of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5,3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease of serum-acid concentration, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vpp / F) of Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma binding of Febuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration range, which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-Marked Febuxostat about 49% of the dose found in the urine as immutable febuxostat (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and its conjugates (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the stool found itself as unchanged Febuxostat (12%), the known oxidative metabolites and its conjugates (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient populations of kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the cmax of Febuxostat did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average overall AUC of Febuxostat took about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of ⋅ yr / ml in the group with normal renal function at 13.2 μ g ⋅ yr / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, with approximately the 11-fold exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of specific Purinmetabolisation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was found that Febuxostat in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in supporting rats with expositions, such as 4.3-fold and with bearing rabbits with expositions, which are about 13-fold of the human therapeutic exposure, have yielded no teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you keep the uric acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the formation of the crystal is prevented and in this way a reduction of the symptoms can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC may not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Inform your doctor before you start taking this drug if you have or had a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem. • If you suffer from a high uric acid concentration in consequence of a cancer or the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare congenital disease in which too much uric acid is in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a rheumatism at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, heat and joint swelling), wait until the attack is cleared before starting with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary, in order to prevent an attack or to treat the associated symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are using medications that may occur one of the following substances, since interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may possibly consider necessary measures. • Theophylin (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (to treat heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">There have been no studies on the effects of ADENURIC on traffic tightness and the ability to operate machines.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data coming from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After 15 weeks of treatment, patients with low vitamin D levels were lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE equals the exact dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), flatulence (ulceration), flatulence (stomach pain), trivial abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as sour upset.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE may not be used in patients with any sensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It should not be used in diseases of the esophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium level) or in patients who cannot stand tall or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following guidelines are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of malophageal irritation and related side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should only be swallowed with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after getting up the day. • The patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal hemorrhages or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Oesophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, malophageal ulcera and malophageal erosions, rarely followed by malophageal corrections, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronate (partly these were severe and required a hospital instruction).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to any signs and symptoms that indicate possible malophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out, in the presence of symptoms of malophageal irritation like dyspagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe malophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or take it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a malophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with alendronate no increased risk was detected, the stomach and duodenal ulcera were rare (after market launch), some of them were severe and with complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecsis of the jaw, usually associated with tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen administered mainly intravenous bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the use of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a maxilbular surgery reduces the risk of osteosrhosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be advised that they should take the pill next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after they noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but take the intake of one tablet per week as planned at the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions occurring.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonecsis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but it was also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the intake of serum Calcium was up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or over-immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulations and the corresponding daily dosage; changes of the formulation or the regimen should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of Tacrolimus Talks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate aftergraft phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with a low level of clearance, an adjustment of the anagraf can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advent therapy should start at 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may later be necessary, as the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advocacy therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - changeover from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted from two daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of anagraphs, so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressants to anagraphs a day, the recommended oral initials dose for the prophylaxis of the graft rejection must begin with the recommended oral initialdose in the kidney and liver transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients that are converted to anagraphs, an oral initialdose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advagraf in pulmonary, pancreatic and colon transplanted patients, occurred in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, with pancreatic transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood tallow in the targeted area, a reduction in the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the renal function does not affect pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potentials of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum cholesterol level, a calculation of the creatinin and monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is recommended (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in an individual case using full blood-tacrolimus Talking Control.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent controls of Tacrolimus Talks during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to advocacy, dose adjustment, alteration of immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous application of substances that could alter the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low level of clearance, adjusting the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the elevation of tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplants is usually between 5 - 20 ng / ml and in adrenal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects that can occur in a result of Tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulations and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regimen should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a medical device experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have been treated as therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation are still available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data for the retarded formulation are still available.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be avoided during treatment with advent (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentration in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septum hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function problems, infections, liquid overload and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun-protective agent with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3 A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood level while offering substances that can change the CYP3 metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain even more consistent levels (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4-inhibitor; hence, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus can be metabolized by means of medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus reduces the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus can increase hormonal exposure, it is particularly cautious when making decisions about contraception measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus could potentially decrease the clearances of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not provide indications that under Tacrolimus a higher risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy exists.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It has been reported on benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours associated with treatment with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialytic.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mode of action and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosolenic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection within the cell nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a specific series of lymphohkin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 patients were transplanted to 475 patients who had undergone a pancreas transplantation and in 630 patients were used as primary immunosuppressant in 630 patients.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral programming in these published studies was consistent with observations in the major studies in which Prograf was used in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral Prograf was reported over 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin in 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was observed in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">Survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, it occurred in 21.7% of the cases caused by bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38,0% among Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) as the number of patients being converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was after 6 months (57.7% versus 45,8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33,3%) in the treatment transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group greater (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study the frequency of the birth of a bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome in patients treated with Tacrolimus was significantly lower.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas transplantation A multicentre study with oral Prograf was conducted on 205 patients who simultaneously received a pancreas and kidney transplantation, which received a randomised procedure of tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (per protocol) from Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then achieved to achieve the desired length of sebum from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colorectal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prof as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplants showed an actual survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrimination and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the Group's unbound group of Tacrolimus or a reinforcement of the metabolism associated with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher levels of clearance observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly through the gall.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients treated with Prograf (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily intake.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to carry out frequent controls of Tacrolimus Talks during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have been treated as therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation are still available.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent haemorrhages in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advocates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced by a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is made differently, so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, among them a study involving 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of hemorrhages in 86% of 510 new blood clots was awarded "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit to transport lawyers in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII, according to the location and extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following heremorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma level (in% of the norm or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients below 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, the recommended dose and frequency of injections is recommended for controlling the dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in reaction to Factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose, a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosage speed should be directed after the patient is found, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the prokoagulatory activity of Factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma via modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, with the risk being most important within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestic known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the recurrence of (low-) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs reported in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all with previously untreated patients showing higher risk of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VIII- Mirror in the Plasma and the Clearance Rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVOC in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavier to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) were observed after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study, 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVOC were treated with inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cellulose; otherwise, there were no signs or symptoms referring to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were reported on the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiler granulocytes in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the ADVATE safety profile, which makes it mandatory every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited granted the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) officially that the company resumes its application for approval for the transport of Advent to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bone or the tissue (tissue that connects other structures in the body surrounds and supports) is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a sort of virus that has been genetically altered in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is an "Adenovirus" that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infection in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin could have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to reform the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is produced from the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the underbelly, bone and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the test of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP opinion it was not proven that the injection of Advantine in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore has advantages for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with advexin.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are disclosed.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effectiveness was the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In examining all hay fever symptoms besides constipation of the nose the patients reported a decrease of the symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in the patients who received desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia, hyperactivity, dizziness, psychomotoric hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or loratadine (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it should be swallowed whole (i.e. without cutting, breaking or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term application can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy in the case of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within the 2 weeks after such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, kleergolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment in the case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Caution is recommended in the treatment of the following patient groups: • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertension • Patients with myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions and can be reduced to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotoric test showed no significant differences between the patients with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol alone.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Enzyme responsible for metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vivo, Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not result in increasing the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and on the basis of the vasoconstrictor properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness, which can lead to impairment of transport impermeability or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, complicated micro-tion, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, excitation, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances, hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is most likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil dire and dilatation, erythema, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include blocking the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhesive molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness was detected at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients between the ages of 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamantagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets did not show significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the course of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the plasma dosing schedule.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the body weight of desloratine, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was carried out as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, four subjects were found to be unable to metabolise desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (cmax and AUC) from pseudoephedrine after the sole treatment of pseudoephedrine bio equivalent was for exposure to the gift of an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with desloratadine cannot identify any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of loratadine / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the application application, Pharmakovigilanzsysteme is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, and its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and drinking or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of desloratadin, very rarely reported cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, itching, swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of heart palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disturbances, headache, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation, and over cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg Lyophilisate for disposing (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml melamine (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syruby and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged 1 to 5 years, the dose is 1,25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrups.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrups.</seg>
<seg id="1722">AERIUS was studied in eight trials involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the nodes, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, solution for inserting and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg AERIUS led to an average decrease in symptom scores (symptom number) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies in Urticaria the decrease in symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with AERIUS 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">AERIUS may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, loratadine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the placing of AERIUS in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of desloratadine in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out in accordance with the previous disease process and can be terminated after the symptoms have been terminated and resumed upon recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persisting allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with desloratine tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, while consuming AERIUS and alcohol, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of traffic jams or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day in patients with AERIUS than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported on more often than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadine and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, administered up to 45 mg of desloratine (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes blocking the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibiting of the expression of the adhesive molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which desloratadine was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which desloratadine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the Neunfold the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of Qtc interval demonstrated.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed 5 mg no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall results of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, AERIUS effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology despite the etiology of different forms is similar and chronic patients can be retroactively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamination is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin is also leading to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guideline.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, AERIUS was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with AERIUS significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study similar to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation following once daily application of desloratine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1763">AERIUS can be taken regardless of meals, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see Section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with AERIUS.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratine constrained and experience higher substance exposure (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of AERIUS syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who are normally metabolise.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. formally announced that the company refuses its application for approval for the placing of Aflunov on the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect from a strain of the flu virus which might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">An influenza pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges that can easily spread from man to man because human beings have not yet built immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">When the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to form a fast antibody in a contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign), was attuned and used as an ingredient of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, ascerase is available as a solution to intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Generic medicine should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined which antiviral drugs the patient has taken before, and the likelihood has been judged that the virus is directed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg. of ritonavir and with other antiviral drugs are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of aspirase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral drugs, asgeneric medicine reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS not cure, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medicine Agenerase with low dosed rideonavir was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had not taken protease inhibitors after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than placebo, but asgenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine induced by Ritonavir lowered the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under Agenerase with Ritonavir for a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Generic medicine may also not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines which are just as well as aspiras and are harmful to the blood in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecsis (death of bone tissue) or an immune response syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors have outweighed the risks for over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Generic Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic decomposition Ritonavir, but the committee confirmed that the benefit of amusing in combination with ritonavir in patients who previously did not have protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally supposed to be under "exceptional circumstances," since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for placing anxieties across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Generic drugs are used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children aged 4 and over.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Ageneric Capsules for pharmacokinetic Boostery of Ampriavir should be administered together with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Ampriavir should be done taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Ampriavir as a solution for weight loss is 14% lower than of amponavir than capsule; therefore, ascerase capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg Ampriavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcement of ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of aspirase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Ampriavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a day-maximum dose of 2400 mg Ampriavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function problems to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Generic medicine may not be used simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amponavir while taking Ampriavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be pointed out that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with aspirase, does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules are supposed to be used along with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased incidence of hepatic dysfunctions in antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of asgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and suppressive adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under international normalised ratio), methods for determining the concentration of active substances are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, ascerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amponavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given at the same time with Ampriavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir to be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylglycol content of the Agenerase solution to intake, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">A rash should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases associated with medications that were associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthritis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrose were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width azionavir may not be used together with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ampriavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the low plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ampriavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the blood sugar level and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the St John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with Ampriavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">Increased for cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ampriavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amponavir were applied twice a day and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if Ampriavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ampriavir in plasma, which were reached twice daily with the combination of Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ampriavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study for the use of agnosine was carried out in combination with didanosin, however, due to the antasia component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ampriavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines are to be used at the same time, caution is advisable since Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ampriavir and ritonavir is difficult on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous dose of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193% and thus a rise in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with agnosine, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with azithromycin in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-10) compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of fossils with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may result in drug interactions, if used together with agulase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Therefore, patients should be monitored for toxic reactions related to these medicines if they are used in combination with agnossis.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as an ascerase, as it can lead to resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiva known as an enzymatic ductor (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a decrease in the plasma level of Ampriavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodidipine and verapamil can be increased by means of amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous consumption with aggrasis can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the associated side-effects with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dose of amusing with ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">With HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma concentrations are expected at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma-level increases in these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror, as plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while offering amponavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenerase may not be used together with oral Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while cautiously with parenteral midazolam, it is advisable to use parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma concentrations of Midazolam around the 3- to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amponavir, the patients should therefore be monitored at opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir to be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation as to how the Ampriavir dose is to be adjusted when Ampriavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with agnosase, increased control of INR (International Normalized Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended as a simultaneous gift of aggrasis (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lacing rats, Ampriavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether Ampriavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the armor in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight in the offspring during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of Ampriavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Asgenerase's harmlessness has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether or not they are in connection with the intake of ascerase or other medicines used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of asgenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory alterations occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal fat accumulation (stitching).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated individuals treated with ampivudine in combination with lamivudine / zidovudin over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stacks) was observed (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">The PROAB 3006 study performed in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Ampriavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderately distinctive, erythematous or macular-like nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amponavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immunodeficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily with low dosed rideonavir (grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were observed very frequently in patients who received Agenerase along with low dosed rideonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary support measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag pol- polyprophylaxis with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Ampriavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentrating (IC50) of Ampriavir is in the range of 0,012 to 0,08 µM in acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Ampriavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamrenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir rootransmitters with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I47V, G48V, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: N = 107) patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors occurred:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic testing systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Ampriavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance to the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, V82A / C / F / G, I84V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Ritonavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistence).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Ampriavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Ampriavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Ampriavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossils of resistance to resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral therapy (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tipranavir), the resistance pathway associated with Ampriavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), inavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Ampriavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failing treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations, which may adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open trial that received PI pre-treated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanaloguine (NRTI) or a standard of care (SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose knight avir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir relative to the SOC-PI group in relation to the time-adjusted average variable (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-loss threshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unblocked aspirase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase's solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dosed ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "" "" "19 Based on these data, the benefit of" "" "" "" "unborn" "" "" "" "aspirase" "" "" "" "should be taken into consideration when optimizing the therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">Increased for cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Ampriavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Ampriavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be attributed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amponavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir that represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total drug concentration in the steam state via the range of cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 have to be administered with caution when they are administered with caution when they are given at the same time (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ampriavir is a 14% less bioavailable solution than from the capsules. therefore, Agenerase's solution and ase-free capsules are not interchangeable on a single milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, so the effect of renal dysfunction should be low on the elimination of Ampriavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those observed in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amponavir twice a day without a simultaneous dose of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amponavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occured in male animals with dosages that corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was not yet elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application, there was little evidence of the assumption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mice lymphoma test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now no significant liver toxicity was observed in clinical studies, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposures, which were significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus jugation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the reinforcement of ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of aspirase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of Ampriavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a day-maximum dose of 2400 mg Ampriavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction. they are contraindicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2068">Increased risk of a lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Ampriavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">Increased for cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Ampriavir Capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Ampriavir in plasma, which were reached twice daily with the combination of Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Ampriavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Ampriavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Ampriavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of Ampriavir and ritonavir is difficult on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with agnosine, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dosage is 31, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodidipine and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with agnosase, increased control of INR (International Normalized Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg norethindron) resulted in a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2102">In addition, since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of Agenerase's solution for weight loss and low dosed rideonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment is not deemed necessary for Ampriavir, an application of Agenerase's solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is indicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylenglycolgehalts, Agenerase solution is contraindicated for small children and children under 4 years, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2174">Application frequency and duration of treatment with aldara depend on the condition to be treated. • For small basal cell carcinomas, the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks. • With acute keratoses, it is repeated five times a week for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Before bedtime the cream is thin layer on the affected skin surfaces, so that it stays on the skin sufficiently long (about eight hours) before it is washed off.</seg>
<seg id="2176">In all studies, Aldara was compared with a placebo (the same cream, but without the active ingredient). • Aldara was tested in four main studies on 923 patients with warts in the genital area for 16 weeks each.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated warts. • Aldara was also studied in 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two studies, in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Aldara or placebo reported either daily or five times a week.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after twelve weeks. • Aldara was also tested in two studies on a total of 505 patients with actinic keratoses.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than placebo. • In the treatment of warts in the genital area, the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15% to 52% in patients treated with placebo. • The results of the two studies on basal cell carcinomas showed a complete response rate of 66% to 80% in patients treated with aldara compared to 0% to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy in intensity or go back after the treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause serious discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 ac- lesions reduced a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune stimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debinding or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were not quantifiable after a unique topical application (&gt; 5ng / ml), no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common adverse events that were shared and likely or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects in the trials with three weeks of weekly treatment were local reactions in the area of treatment of tilt nipples (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most common reported and likely or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects include discomfort at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated with imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, as probable or possibly with the application of imiquimod cream related side effects were a response to the application location (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical signs prescribed according to the study diagram show that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with three weeks of treatment with imiquimod cream, local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), exkoriation / scrolling (23%) and oedema (14%) occurred (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the study plan, the clinical signs prescribed by the study show that five times weekly treatment with imiquimod cream was very common to severe erythemic subjects (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe shrinkage and ruin (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies evaluating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental oral intake of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hypotony, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy studies have shown that the efficacy in the treatment of leg warts is significantly superior in Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the total of 119 patients treated with imiquimod the Flt warts were completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the 105 with placebo-treated patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of imiquimod in five-time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinoma with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically healed and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of imiquimod in three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">The patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, not hypertrophic, not hypertrophic ac- lesions within a 25 cm2 large treatment area on the hairless scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external flywarts, actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma typically do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systematic intake of the 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were treated in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half-life after subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of imiquimod after topical application was low on MC-affected skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to those with healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity of the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg were significantly reduced body weight and increased lactic weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application gave no similar effects to the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice on three days per week did not induce tumours on the site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, a risk for humans due to systemic exposure can be regarded as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the mentioned side effects you significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not specified in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignices (Condylomata acuminata), which have formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● Surface basal cell carcinoma This is a frequently occurring, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very little probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to abnormalities, especially in the face - for this reason, early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used with flat actinic keratoses in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the best suitable treatment for you.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, swellings of the skin or difficulties can be expected when the foreskin is withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not use Aldara cream in the urethra, in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or inside the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medications have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than a treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse with genital warts in the genital area, treatment with Aldara cream is after sexual intercourse (not before) perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you apply other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not quench your infant during treatment with Aldara cream, as it is not known whether Imiquimod enters into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different for bid warts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the tilt warts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully covered.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin must remove the foreskin every day and wash the skin underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream for 6 weeks each week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you do not feel comfortable during the application of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too much to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A low number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infection; it can cause a blue stain to appear sooner or cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the mentioned side effects you significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions that resonate within 2 weeks after the treatment is finished.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the location of application (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, loss of skin, skin destruction, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes to the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, heat feeling or discomfort), throat pain, diarrhea, actinic keratosis, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, limb pain, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the motions more difficult, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with aldurazyme should be supervised by a physician who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with resuscitation devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but it also measured its effectiveness (by examining its effect in reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children demonstrated a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Frequent side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all the new information that may be disclosed every year and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will monitor patients who receive aldurazyms in regards to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the Genzyme Europe B.V. to approve the transport of aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamsters Ovary, chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyme should be carried out by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h, if the patient tolerates this, can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of aldurazyms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where resuscitation facilities for medical emergencies are available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding resumption of the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment has to be cautiously preceded.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before beginning infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to treat the potential incidence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighted and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular uptake of laronidase consists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">TIEREXPERIMENTAL studies do not directly or indirectly affect the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical studies were primarily classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with aldurazyms observed during the phase 3 study and prolongation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over for a duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, airstills and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects related to aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with a predominantly severe form of treatment and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients experienced a seroconversion within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe follow-up form usually within one month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until premature excretion from the study), patients with 13 / 45 were not present by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, among them 3 patients with whom it never came to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels had a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, while a variable decrease of GAG in the urine was observed in patients with high antibody levels.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient reestablishment of enzymatic activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells in the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of the patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the total distance in the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group, as indicated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the total lung capacity increased proportionally to the height of adults of adults.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant drop in the GAG mirror was detected in the urine (µg / mg of creatinine), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">With regard to the heterogeneous disease of the disease between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, clinically significant changes were summarized for five efficiency variables (expected percentage of patients with 58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-open phase 2 study was conducted, in which Aldurazyme's safety and pharmacokinetics were studied in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg during the last 26 weeks due to increased gagine levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe follow-up form only limited or no progress in cognitive development were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosage schemes were carried out on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2356">To decrease side effects, patients should receive corticosteroids as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, an additional anti-emetic medicine (medicine against vomiting) and fluids (to prevent a lack of fluids) should be given.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood image changes or where certain other side effects occur, treatment should be postponed, decomposed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form enters into cancer cells more easily than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural endothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer the effects of Alimta were compared in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (other medicines for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin outlived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelium cells in the administration of Alimta showed prolonged survival rates than with the comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for placing Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4,2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml further (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with low-Kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered intravenous infusion of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² of KOF as an infusion about a period of 2 hours after completion of the Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell carcinoma after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF administers intravenous infusion of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift and on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) a week before the first Pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood image should be created prior to each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, dose testing must take place under consideration of the neadir of the blood picture or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the prevalent therapeutic cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3 that can be used for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ degree 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA, until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA needs to be aborted if in patients after 2 dose-reducers a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- fort scale 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, there is an increased side effect risk in patients aged 65 years or older.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary for dose adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold upper Bilift limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) were not studied especially in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be supervised in terms of bone marosuppression and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophal number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thromboccyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte numbers and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and nichthonatological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia has been observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be treated to treat folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for the reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous ingestational antiphlogistical (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients receiving treatment with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetrexed treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the transcellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out prior to the treatment of the treatment to obtain advice concerning the preservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">High doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1.3 g daily) can lead to reduced Pemetrexed excretion in patients with normal kidney function (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day).</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable when used in patients with normal renal function (creatinin-clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed are avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as piro- xicam or rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy necessitates an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Normalised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren Antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy except where mandatory and after careful balancing of use for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out prior to the treatment beginning to obtain counselling regarding semen volume.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed goes into breast milk and unwanted effects in breastfed infants cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and that were randomized cisplatin and Pemetrexed, as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who received randomized cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2418">Clinically relevant CTC toxicity reported at &lt; 1% (occasionally) of patients randomised Pemetrexed included supraventricular arrhythmias.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The clinically relevant laboratory toxicity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the Phase 2 results of three Pemetrexed monotherapy studies (n = 164), except neutropenia (12.8% compared with 5.3%) and an increase in the alanine transaminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population, as the Pha- se 2 studies included both chemonaive and significantly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were treated before, during or after their Pemetrexed therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifolate, which exerts its effect by interrupting important folate-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an anti-folate with several targets by blocking the thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT).</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus cisplatin in low-grade pleural endothelioma, showed that with ALIMTA and cisplatin treated patients had clinically significant advantage of a survival in median 2.8-months compared to those patients who were treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleural hearing loss was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin-arm (212 patients) in relation to the sole cispla-tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The difference between the two arms was improved by improving the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicentre, randomised, open phase III trial with ALIMTA versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy showed a median survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on the overall survival fell in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate epithelial histological type (n = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1,00, p = 0.047), adapted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1,08-2,26, p = 0,018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a separately randomised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for Pemetrexed are similar for Pemetrexed between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pre-treatment with docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The efficacy analyses of the PQ population are consistent with the analyses of the ITT population and support the non-superiority of the ALIMTA Cisplatin combination vis-à-vis gemcitabine cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli compared 391 patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who participated alone had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patients with relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches at anus, flatus (winch) with bowel movement, stuhldiness, greasy / oily chair, leaving oily secretion (strings), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (for preventing organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It must also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease) suffer, and in pregnant women or nursing mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a lightly hypokaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and young people under 18, as there is not enough data for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimally resorbed, it is not necessary to adapt the dosage to elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken along with a fat-rich single meal or low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the reduction in weight in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dose of these medicines has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancies in order to prevent possible failure of oral contracepts in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with concurrent use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants combined with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally standardized ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat for up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained in normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplemental multivitamin preparations before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamin absorption (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose Amiodarone was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time, a minor decrease in the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2526">TIEREXPERIMENTAL studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and related to the pharmacological effect of the medicine as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), sometimes (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects detected after the market launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after market launch of orlistat overdose, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, a quick recovery of possible systemic effects caused by orlistat's lipasing properties can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect occurs in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active serine rest of gastran and pancreatic drops.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, 60 mg orlistat was taken three times a day, blocking absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypokaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average temperature in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of not metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in the plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients, which was administered to a minimal systemic resorbated dose, two main metabolites (M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-molylleucine group) were identified, representing approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated dose, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the mentioned side effects you significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the effects of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment, as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimise diet-related side effects: • Begin almost a few days or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal, not to take them in the form of a fat main dish or a substantial dessert, as you might have done in other programs for weight loss. • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur, learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>

<seg id="2595">Obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases, such as: • Bluthochrome • Diabetes • Heart Disease • Osteoarthritis</seg>
<seg id="2596">Lasting weight loss, for example by improving nutrition and more exercise, can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients, and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you also find as an indication of food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Note the below tables below. • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">The quantity for you is the information below, which indicates the number of calories suitable for you. • Because of the capsule's mode of action, compliance with the recommended fat supply is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By complying with the recommended fat intake, you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likelihood of diet-related side effects. • You should try to decrease progressively and continuously.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight about 0.5 kilograms per week, without developing frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher is your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you do not walk daily, work in the garden or perform other physical activities. • "Middle physical activity" means that you burn 150 kcal per day, e.g. by 3 km walk, 30- to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For permanent weight loss, it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and keep them in. • Sense is a nutritional diary with information about calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before starting alli.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed on calorie and fat-induced nutrition and give guidelines to becoming more physically active.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alopecia is used in chemotherapies which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as for chemotherapies, which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The potency of Aloxi can be increased by the addition of a corticosteroids (a medicine used as an anti-emetic medicine).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information about the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is binding a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) to inhibit the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Aloxi was examined in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate solvers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with alopecia showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, which is moderate for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with alopecia showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted its approval to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of a cancer condition and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alopecia for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon massage, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of a tedious ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required in concurrent administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where Qt interval is prolonged or which tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy treatment Aloxi will not be used either for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutics directed against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cycloabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a Steady-State- concentration of oral metocloprams, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous dose of CYP2D6 inductors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Paroxetine, Chinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences on the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies are not prevalent, therefore, palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common adverse events at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing testimonials.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar frequencies of adverse events like in the other dosage groups showed themselves; there were no dose-active relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective treatment for an Aloxi- overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 micrograms or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg Ondansetron (half-life time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-life time of 7.2 hours) that was given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double blind study, a total of 667 patients who received much emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and dacarbazin and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg ondansetron, which were given intravenously in day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of trials with moderate-emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials evaluating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ionic channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-value of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and the area below the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dosed proportionately in the overall dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to an intravenous dose of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34% was observed between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg of palonosetron achieved total exposure to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg was comparable; however, the cmax was higher after granting 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% of the kidneys are eliminated and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the amino acid enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -palonosetron was found around 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unaltered active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous injection in healthy eyes the overall length of the body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While patients with severe liver dysfunction have increased the terminale elimination period and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified by this.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures that are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which suggests a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, evidence suggests that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to 30-fold the therapeutic exposure in humans), given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal disease) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages and since Aloxi is determined by humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low as for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The European Commission must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) passed a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the placing of the drug for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A with the same dentist element that is already approved in the EU (also called "Reference Insurfers").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination, the liver tissue damages damage, and the values of the liver enzyme alanine amine-ransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which stimulates this for the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data which substantiate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medication (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed in the absence of data on the stability of the drug and the pharmaceuticals market.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjusting the treatment with Alpheon the disease flared up again in more patients than with the reference medicinal product; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study was to investigate the extent to which the medicament dissolves an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by crust formation) and small infected infirings (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Alargo should not be used to treat infections that were detectable or presumably caused by methicillinlinic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this kind of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial strains (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the treatment ended.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients underwent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together on skin wounds, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in treating abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were detectable or probably caused by MRI.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks associated with short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmary, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the placing of Altargo on the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or severe local irritation by applying Retapamulin Salbe the treatment should be aborted, the ointment meticulously wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary open wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected position.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations found in people after topical use on isolated skin or infected surface wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and cmax after topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment on a diminished skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / terminates or the treatment with Altargo continues / terminated, it is advisable to weigh the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which Altargo had applied, the most common reported side effect was Irritation at the administration site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50S subunit of the bacterial reef, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data suggest that the binding site ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferasecenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking partial P-bind interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance the use of retapamulin at at least some types of infection appears questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treat S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study of healthy adults, 1% retapamulin ointment was applied daily by occlusion to intact and slanted skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before mediation and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 effective skin (cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomen was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid cancers.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro studies on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats-micro-nucleus test for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of abraded skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were determined in oral dosages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-times the estimated human exposure (see above)), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed killing) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for the placing of goods must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1, is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the market is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for the placing on the market commits itself to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the Pharmacovigilance plan, as they have been accepted in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the MP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for" products for human use, "the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Suggest irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with altargo if it was not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, in the mouth, or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile bandage or a gauze strip unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic cap containing 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambiani is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged 1 to 15, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In the context of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, Ambirix will be administered as part of a second dose of protection against hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization, and it is ensured that the existing vaccination plan can be carried out from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is required for hepatitis A or B, ambix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by helping the immune system (the natural defence of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and creates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix includes the same components as the approved vaccine Twinrix adults since 1996 and since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose-existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambiani and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as a proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambirix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentration against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambiani was similar to a six-month and a 12-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambiani (observed in more than 1 of 10 doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambiani may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.a. a permit for the transport of Ambirix all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan for priorization with Ambirix is made up of two doses, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent people who have responded to a Hepatitis A vaccine need a refresher vaccination, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in the case of no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the treatment of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardising scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and Anti-HBs antibody is achieved after the primeval process, so that in these cases the application of further vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal impediment, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, ambient temperature can be injected subcutaneous as it can come to bleedings after intramuscular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambiani was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelia and Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measles mumps rocking vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, mateness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thiomerular and preservative-containing vaccine formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses of Ambiani were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and thickness on a calculation basis per vaccination dose of Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the application of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects received Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the test persons vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of stiffness was comparable per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the test persons who received the Ambirix level compared to 36.2% in subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and stiffness was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3-dose regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparison study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambiani a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines that reported severe side-effects during the 2-dose-vaccination scheme with Ambiani or during the 3-dose vaccine scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units as a combination vaccine infected hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccines aged 1 to including 15 years, the serum levels for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Serum conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was discordable, the serum rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after gift of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds a month after completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the Vaccines received either a 2-dose-vaccination scheme with an ambix or a 3-dose vaccine scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to those found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12 to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and Anti-HBs-antibodies was shown 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme to the in the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refresher of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelia and 8 haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps riot vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates similar to previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is examined for any foreign particles and / or physically visible alterations, both before and after resuspening.</seg>
<seg id="2773">According to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the state of charge is granted by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may possibly require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely protect from infection with hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines, (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vaccine), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambiani or any ingredient of this vaccine including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you / your child already have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled administration of the second dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / her child from a vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis A / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a viral hepatitis B virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection prior to the completion of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected with people suffering from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defenses / is or if you / your child undergoes a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient, so a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21. tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines (including those that you have received without prescribing) or if you / your child has been vaccinated recently / has received / has received / has received immunoglobulins (antibodies) or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given to ambient temperature at the same time, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambient temperature is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, pregnant or breastfeeding women are not administered unless they are vaccinated against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambiani Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2805">Based on the data that have been known since the initial approval for placing on the market, the CHMP reported that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambiani remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambiani has only been put into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug are limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defects or with hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders or flavor version, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle were effectively prevented from high ammonia values.</seg>

<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete lack of enzyme already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, manifested after the first month of life), an indication of the use occurs when the anamnesis consists of hyperammonic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerances and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamide synthetase or ornicotinscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency should get arginine in a dose of 0,4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk for the formation of oesophagulcera if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as associated with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it resulted in slowing the neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In 56% of patients in clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one adverse event occurred (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed to be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, artery octopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity during IV administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg per day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active compound which is jugated by acetylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys via acetylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with onset of the first symptoms in newborns was previously almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through haemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (but within the first life month) of diagnosed diseases to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonic encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithinkoepylase deficiency), which were recovering from a hyperactive encephalopathy and afterwards treated persistently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyl and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after injection of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis after individual delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following iv administration of sodium phenylbutyl (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyl concentrate were detected 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycle problems or haemoglobin, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) was not detectable in plasma after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis treated with sodium phenylbutyl (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted via the kidneys within 24 hours of about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyl rat had no conclusive effects in toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (infants and children who cannot swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or Gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat occurs: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight more than 20 kg and for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamide synthetase or ornicotinscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contain 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyl), lesions were found in the pyramids of the brain bark.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate dosis, severe hypokalemia, artery octopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); Phenyl acetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus acid</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram recorded sodium phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyl concentrate were detected 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During shelf life, the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS may be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you undertake laboratory tests, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the drug may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, disappearance of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and deterioration of existing neurological conditions were also observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2876">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take oral care of AMMONAPS in the same single doses or via a gastric fistula (tube, which runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall) or a nasal probe (hose, which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped spoonful of pomulat out of the container. • Take a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess granules. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoons granulate from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for instance in case of unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest of different thicknesses) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (an anomalous measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox in the sole dose or in connection with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients receiving a PCI, angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other brain cells or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve Angiox's placing in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous diameter of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another row, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion should be increased for the duration of the procedure to 1,75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, dosage of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous injection of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediately following intravenous infusion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an all-in Bolus administration of Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended, even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstitutive and diluted medicine should be mixed carefully before the application and the bolus dose is quickly given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restrictions (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to PCI (whether with bivalirudin or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose of 0,3 mg / kg is administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose is checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the Bivalirudin-Bolus was administered without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• serious hypertension and / or irreversible disturbances due to disturbance of the hemostatic system and / or irreversible disturbances. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though, in case of PCI patients suffering from bivalorudin most bleedings on arterial puncture points can occur in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during treatment in principle bleeding can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Normalised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting treatment with bivalirudin is again attained before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors) it can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalearudin with thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, debinding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">In both the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding such as table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bialidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area requiring radiological or surgical intervention, hemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed haemorrhage localizations, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bivalearudin in 6,000 patients who have submitted a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">In both the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, it was more common in women and patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects that are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately interrupted and the patient is closely monitoring with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thromtase inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the anion binder region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bicuirudin to thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because thrombin its part slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of thromboine.</seg>

<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalira were evaluated in patients who were subjected to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that as peptide, Bivalirudin performs a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent reuse of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite, which results from the division of the ARG3-pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin, is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombosis.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, the thighs or upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or unable to process the insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from the human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter mode of operation than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisper.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Apidra cans may have to be modified when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for placing Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of abdominal sacks.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs in patients with a restriction of liver function may be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the mode of action, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may undergo a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin to another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of the occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramides, fibreates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, salicylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine, the symptoms of adrenergic regulation should be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">TIEREXPERIMENTAL studies on reproductive toxicity did not show any differences between Insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not exceed the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the adverse drug releases known from clinical studies grouped by system organ classes and ordered according to the decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or trembling, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive hun-, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a correspondingly trained person or by intravenous injection of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucoagic injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous ga- be of insulin lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male patients aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin showed a proportional amount of glucose-lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional rise in the glucosic effect, just like insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a double as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postprandial glycaemic control is achieved, as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">After serving insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the meal begins, a similar glycemic control is achieved, as with a human normal insulin which is given 2 mids before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before starting the meal compared to human normal insulin which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal (Fig. 1A) and compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after meal) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal-painting, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
