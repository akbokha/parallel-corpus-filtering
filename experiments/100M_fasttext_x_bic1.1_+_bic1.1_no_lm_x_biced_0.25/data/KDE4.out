package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings extensions .... open the card @-@ card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard inser@@ tion modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are available on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package containing &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Extras Depar@@ ture . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes , if any , delete .
the module An@@ gle filter ( also called Folder Filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar below Extras address filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root bur@@ r of the document , Ex@@ ample : docum@@ ent@@ ric , all other knot@@ s are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle whose surface is proportional to its size .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder is mir@@ r@@ ored , while the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily identified if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ emap presentation a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is sufficient space to display , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( where , consequently , representation errors can occur with the mark of the path ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ tangle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps performance algorithms , the rule should be observed , that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always adher@@ ed . it will be drawn frame to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and that frame will need space that will then no longer be available to the subordin@@ ate entries .
how to divide the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always prefer@@ able for the lab@@ eling and avoi@@ dance of space losses through fra@@ me@@ works so that rec@@ tan@@ gles arise that are as square as possible . the best methods of this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry view at area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
you can find the Picture Gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Gallery ... or C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery , a dialog opens , which allows you to specify the image of the gallery .
the page title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the images per line option has a slide bar and a turn@@ table to set the number of images of each line in the gallery .
specify the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image to see if the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nail in the gallery .
specify the file size of the image to see if the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nail in the gallery .
with the image size check box , specify if the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub @-@ folders should be included .
in the file selection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
to include the sub @-@ folder with the sub @-@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub @-@ folders are included .
copy the original pictures with the box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
using the box comment file , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ turing the images in the gallery .
in the box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail pictures than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the navig@@ ator can be set here :
the Media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Menu under Window Navigation , or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navigation pane , and drag the music files you want to hear in media playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
change browser recognition adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition , you can change the browser and operating system identi@@ fier for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that den@@ ies access to this browser , change browser recognition to one of the following options .
change the password to M@@ SIE pages that deny access to browsers on the base of Moz@@ illa . for example , you need the M@@ SIE browser recognition to run with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the website you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry , you can set the scope of information about the browser used and the operating system in each individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Web@@ page . you can check the following tests :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ plug ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; attempts to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error report system . all information you need is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; is a project supported by a community . that is , if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ plug ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ plug ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; visit home page to get news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ es ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ plug ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can enter a local , remote , or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . digi@@ K@@ am settings set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; view every sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; thir@@ dly recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders unless it &apos;s the case in hidden folders . you can do this by placing one point in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you &apos;ve configured the base folder , you can get in &amp; digi@@ plug ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw File Support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can &amp; digi@@ plug ; possibly handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw camera support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ ners and Ro@@ h Work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together .
modern digital cameras exc@@ el through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transfer to the calcul@@ ator , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras supporting a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ is@@ sions over serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that digi@@ K@@ am preview images can be read reliably . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ came ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Module : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Manual ) is one approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; to provide K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ plug ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page strings with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
moving and laying pictures works everywhere : you can store a picture in another part of the al@@ ab@@ yte , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only limitation is that you can &apos;t place an image in keywords , data comparison list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . so filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame will only work if this is shown in the tool@@ bar . which fields can be displayed in the Al@@ ben@@ ds dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by folders where they were stored on the hard disk , sorted by the name of their collection in the al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album imports images . you can also add a scre@@ enshot to an album . select Album imports scre@@ enshot .
to copy or move an image from an album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the menu then you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to gather information about this collection . to access the album properties , you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and edit the album properties in the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you choose is used to sort your photos after collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums after collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
the buttons mature , average , ne@@ sts : these set the date to the date of the oldest , the latest image or that of the average of the album . to do this , first attempt to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and click on the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview , select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ignored .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; support the entry of key@@ word for individual photos in the area My key@@ word list left down in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid using all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . which information this is , you can edit digi@@ plug settings ; change it . select the Albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you have a moment to rest over a picture , the help shows the most important features including all the key features of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all that happened at &amp; digi@@ came ; works . albums and Tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can select all the features with &amp; digi@@ plug . you can choose between the viewing of images , a slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... selecting . in the digi@@ plug section ; image editing , you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view and change your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . the applications listed there are controlled by the &amp; k@@ de ; file assignments for the file type .
some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two ways to rotate . the easiest is to click on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can right click on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you have a photo from &amp; digi@@ plug ; delete , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ e@@ tion or delete if you &apos;d rather want to delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ der quot ; organiz@@ es your photos according to the data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . Tags are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or entire groups can be assigned . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search again .
when a key@@ word is selected , all the photos marked with this key@@ word will be shown .
Tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also work parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords li@@ pi@@ quot ; fold up so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the key words are stored in a database for fast access and assigned key@@ word in the image &apos;s IP@@ TC data fields , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the key words are re @-@ imported in the loss of the database as soon as the digi@@ comes ; the pictures are noticed .
you can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word , or click on an existing key@@ word and then choose New Key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this will become the sub@@ title of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and laying there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want with a key@@ word , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word , drag and drop it . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu key@@ word .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can use a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the Tags @-@ menu . the menu shows only the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hi@@ sto@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hi@@ sto@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rec@@ tangle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the box below you can type a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
encomp@@ ass all items of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
when you click here , the filter will be deleted and all the pictures are displayed again . if the search hasn &apos;t found anything , then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with the bino@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will see a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search that filters what you have entered as a search criteri@@ on .
when you &apos;re satisfied with your selection , hit the head OK and the search is done . the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search , you just need to select the appropriate entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Search , the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information . if you select As extended search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced Search section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ es ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database . all rules are added line @-@ wise , separated by operators . an option can be added with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , None ... or At least ... . in addition , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CHT@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; character@@ izes any image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one . using a tres@@ hold , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you move an image from somewhere over the icon of the tongue search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free @-@ hand paint sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ plug ; find matching images . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive navigation tool based on the Marble Mini@@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out zoom or hold it and move it . move it while you pull the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the box below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a light table in a separate window allowing you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the light table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened . if you are back in the window , you can open the illuminated table quickly with L Extras .
from the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select Pre@@ view synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform Zoo and dep@@ ortation operations on one of the images , you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly retri@@ eve from a series of images . if you use pairs from the tool@@ bar , the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . now , use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal fire transactions work directly from the light table , such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the main window &apos;s right side bar is available in the illuminated table for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you need to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in preview , both images will display the same image area .
just use the zoom @-@ knob under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in preview .
what is a digital asset management - away from the fashion word ? digital asset management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken right up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes , scans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your pictures . in doing so , we concentrate on the process for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ plug ; we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , archiving , optim@@ ising , waiting and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is data stored in accordance with your definition , providing information on or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t need to find a certain photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you care for anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
you may be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can quickly be found in the same place . if you make enough photos , you will be able to use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant feeding of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes stac@@ king handling easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the metadata option stored in &amp; digi@@ plug &apos;s settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget it , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so &amp; digi@@ plug ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , labels and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value then . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos for further work .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or Categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert images in the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drawing a sub@@ tree to another .
this is a very rough representation , since each blo@@ c contains metadata in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from a distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing field of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so , the in@@ scription has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the subject that has moved you to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . K@@ DE also provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images to web galleries , then these labels will not tell you a second time after your wishes into the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it Earth a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now driving with speed of light .
I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel using pictures with ge@@ ographic data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; can also export k@@ ml files you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the furnishing page of &amp; digi@@ kam , as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples may be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled out .
editor ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a store photo , then here is the group / agency that offers the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this metadata in the image . for private individuals this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section , it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated careful and you can no longer trust you as a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they al@@ tern through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faul@@ ty CDs and DVDs there is a cheaper program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
don &apos;t forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then on a clean , dark dry and shel@@ tered location . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
Disk@@ managers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s products include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : flo@@ ppy disk devices
the most common cause of error , S@@ MAR@@ T , is the most common cause of error . S@@ MAR@@ T &apos;s errors are the most common cause of error . some of S@@ MAR@@ T detect the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are in particular read errors and publishing counter . the expected duration of life is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before securing the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electric appliances do not make much noise , this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause severe damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects .
the most widespread protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is a sur@@ ge protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy slots and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug connector . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also make sure that it provides protection against lighten@@ ing and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since the over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the television map .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable sur@@ ge protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models even allow them to continue working until the current is running . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security in case of electricity distur@@ ban@@ ces with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to 30 euro ; 20 costs , one 500@@ W US@@ V you can get for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . finally , you should remember how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
however , compared to the hard drives at home , however , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very safe . data transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ is@@ sions are prone to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
the worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these disorders remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have one day to open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they create inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors on a low level and highly scal@@ able . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available in a G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f fil@@ esystem . this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebooks and 46 % on work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to minor damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most popular fil@@ es@@ ystems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process with a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras include 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ apixel . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 750@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anybody else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , backup your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the re @-@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , aster@@ oids always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Security : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential security .
incre@@ mental F@@ USE : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that have really been changed . this is done compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have them stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of your working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly schedule for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month .
topics : metadata that stored IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retained XMP files , original retained , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , vision devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the print expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means more and more .
let &apos;s assume that you have set up the scal@@ ability and want to expand the area you want to expand to a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; d@@ d if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc ( source is / dev / s@@ dc / dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ gt ; # works with ext@@ 3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the extension if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be simpler from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
PNG can be used as an open source standard of GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports XMP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . the dis@@ advantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and have a slow compression .
TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages pictures in high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licence @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is designed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace Adobe &apos;s XML @-@ based XMP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . XMP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , the raw format is old . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put it together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera service are , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for fine @-@ layer processing . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were , under certain circumstances , cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the addition of a photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your album database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it attempts to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ ous indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not display any preview images . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol are shown for your file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the aspect properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ plug ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , you can download the download and then select S@@ elected . the S@@ elected button will be displayed as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images were not yet downloaded by &amp; digi@@ plug . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download all of the buttons you download or download selected , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of the existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you &apos;ve selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you must first select it and then delete the selected deleted .
please note that there are no photos that you deleted from the camera . the photos are not deleted in the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; you should carefully check if the photos have been downloaded successfully into a digi@@ plug ; -@@ Album if you want to completely er@@ ase them from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera memory , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos of different recording series to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for turning and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created once a day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three other options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two are related to the data on the author in the Standard Car Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ os@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in lo@@ wer@@ case when you download . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording , to perform an automatic rotation during sh@@ utter . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , lets &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made , and digi@@ plug , use this to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ directory . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar Met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the option date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the images are to be up@@ loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in Longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map . identifying the data can be carried out by the American GPS , Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to draw the posi@@ tional data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about re@@ working the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic mapping ( manual ) and last via manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmitt@@ ing the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ dt or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format because this is the only format supported by the ge@@ ographic mapping module .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the length and width degrees or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters of hair@@ y coordinates created , for example , map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; attempts to give you so much control over its workflow as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ came ; change . to access these settings , you need to set up in the Settings menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be set on Embedded Pre@@ view or Rest@@ ore image processing . you set the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fix when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standar@@ dis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for writers : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this may be labels such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify what the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here because this is the image of others &amp; quot ; then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC fields . this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the digi@@ plug database ; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ plug ; imported without being lost .
image cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images save : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the images . this allows you to read your cap@@ tions from other screen viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options that appear when the mouse cur@@ sor is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ es ; attempt to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in any &amp; digi@@ plug ; file folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored by &amp; digi@@ plug ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the Light of &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better picture results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors are set here . in image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation .
with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the TIFF command option compression , you can turn the default compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it has no influence on image quality because the Def@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setup , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . at the moment , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image processing settings .
the default behavior is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight pixel of the CCD sensor is more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . this option draws the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G- or A@@ HD quality method .
if set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is a solid color balance based on a white card photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images will get more details in four steps in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned into , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the pointed lights , as a continuous white look . the setting colors trigger some unusual results , since they display the top lights in various shades of pink . last , you can try some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ rou@@ ds to recon@@ struct .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions out of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option re@@ constructions , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this may later be done in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color @-@ design .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ directional ) was the quality for me and the paper used by me .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction since it is done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as it should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information on how to translate colour information from a color space in the other so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
create the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles .
settings of the ICC @-@ Pro@@ files you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; default source ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when the raw file is opened later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are colored not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of Profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate just how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors may therefore work very saturated . this could manually correct you instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . naturally , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewing and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be downloaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings brief commands .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the picture transi@@ tions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check boxes switch the metadata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
on the right side there is a button Automatic recognition that tries to identify a camera attached to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the screen mode . currently , serial ports , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only activated if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera selected from the camera list . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / dig@@ its , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn it on .
check whether &amp; digi@@ es ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be shown in the main window &apos;s cameras . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images to the du@@ st@@ bin , you can display the digi@@ tization of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details in del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly charged by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option Chan@@ ges in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also display the display of the &amp; digi@@ plug welcome screen ; this speeds up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
the setting At Start for new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ plug to look for new or deleted albums / photos . this pro@@ lon@@ gs the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; if something was deleted from the base folder , the digi@@ came ; you , if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ es ; used to custom@@ ize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; includes quick image processing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit .
image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; they may not be part of your distribution . you may also find more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , displaying file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor , and current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved the file Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore File menu or the button Un@@ restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last saving .
nearly every action of image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can undo by selecting undo / res@@ etting Edit from the menu .
if you frequently use this , use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture or the entries in the File menu . if you made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; Mouse Whe@@ el or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can change this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window . see the section for setting image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or entire phrases . whole image templates can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export job super@@ visor . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navigation arrows , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the page bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
next to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you &apos;ve chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the app@@ rais@@ al section evalu@@ ates a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ dings . it can either be applied with a single mouse click on the 5 stars to the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the en@@ coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a drop @-@ down box with previously used keywords .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when typ@@ ing keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate cross@@ fields in the tree . all key words of an image are key@@ word stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if several images are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section .
the key@@ bar stu@@ b termin@@ ator is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - date , key@@ word and search views is used . if additionally one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the inter@@ section of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and dis@@ close keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears , which asks you if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter stands on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched from settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rule area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an extended search over all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors you have from your camera or scanner can have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make sure that links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result .
if your picture work@@ flows meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and then think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to make my monitor calli@@ graphic if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ RGB color space or not , you need to calli@@ graphic your monitor since s@@ RGB works on s@@ RGB so you need to calli@@ graphic your monitor on s@@ RGB @-@ Standard , use a matching monitor profile , or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting to further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alizing , balancing , automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ise Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hi@@ sto@@ gram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the compar@@ isons have very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic compensation : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hi@@ sto@@ gram range .
extending contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a re @-@ ji@@ b@@ tion of all values in between . this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the White Balance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can be too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , then your possibilities for correction will be better off .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will dynam@@ ically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , click the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the el@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
to the right , a hi@@ sto@@ gram appears that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hi@@ sto@@ gram is very helpful , even in well lit photos , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above @-@ mentioned controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance to the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colours when more than one pixel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons saving and loading make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later .
the default settings button cle@@ ars all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the en@@ coding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool will open the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guide to use color profiles lets you consult the chapter colour management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so you can also use your settings so you always need the same correction . in the manual for correct ton@@ ing correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a sol@@ ar@@ isation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called the Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure from the extra light . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the delicate photographic paper from the extra light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the intensity applied is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment to experiment the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the Tool Ton@@ cker Cor@@ rection is used to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ der for the purpose described here . more specifically the three sli@@ ders below the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hi@@ sto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked inside and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control knob and make sure that the picture changes .
on the right hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box , it is possible to set whether the hi@@ sto@@ gram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , linear visu@@ alization is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ tes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used for creating an easy image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later . in addition , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
when you use this mode and three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on preview of the original image to set the hi@@ sto@@ gram for red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview , and no effect can be seen in the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ de channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is usually the most useful . for images with large areas of constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve edge to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspon@@ ded with dar@@ ker output tones and that the image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change , a fitting line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if over@@ exposed pixels are found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ p@@ sed channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or to change the color shade of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hi@@ sto@@ gram . this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram appears to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the picture will also retain the general brightness as the channel mixer is then the tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . colour@@ full consists of small spatial arti@@ facts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you first reduce the colour space .
save and load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the g@@ im@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview , and no effect can be seen in the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step as color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and enhances the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epithel@@ ium : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aching a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ ia pad . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply mold texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the impression of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Add a tool box can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , you insert the desired frame type for your image . passing through the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce str@@ anded with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it borders with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a pop @-@ up effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also works in several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text output , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . the bigger the picture , the bigger the character set needs to be .
any setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply mold Tem@@ plate you can place a template using a picture .
the menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the digi@@ plug , please send an email to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you are using this tool for the first time , you must set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view mirrors which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the thumb@@ nail of the templates .
in the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very quick and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ dynamic . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process paints colors with only minimal differences to a col@@ lage . the same phenomenon can be observed when color pixels are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more det@@ ri@@ mental sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private users .
a camera internal sharp@@ ness has often been applied to JPEG pictures . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners have a field filter already during reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the Shar@@ pen@@ ing Tool . you can get sharpen@@ ing using the menu entry .
you should use it carefully as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus it through the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ation . under re@@ focusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is much simpler than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ens and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or amount rein@@ force the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of atro@@ cities will produce near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best sharp@@ ens pictures in their final resolution .
the amount sets the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . thus , you can define a minimum difference with it for a edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are removed from shar@@ pen and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tration . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is using a bl@@ ur@@ red mask . re@@ focus usually achieves better results than bl@@ ur@@ red mask .
in practice , the circular f@@ ission has a very long tail , which results in a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular focus : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should yield 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is bl@@ ur@@ red then pay attention to hal@@ o notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 , the picture quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 .
Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is g@@ auss . in most cases you should leave this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a non @-@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the gauge . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not visible immediately , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , in@@ accurate mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mask using a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp masks must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharp@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ ear filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Wiener filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regulator smooth@@ es the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the colour ink allows a customized colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ jection Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
detail preservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth surfaces and let details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
directional dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise will generate a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above every@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is available , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed through . usually , here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle steps &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . so , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal . however , it dou@@ bles the running time . therefore , we recommend it to om@@ it it .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button cancel .
below you can see how screen errors can be removed with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool sel@@ ects sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wi@@ pe the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller errors adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value places the pixel spac@@ ing at the front looking to see light density changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter can no longer get image details and h@@ iss or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not all noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the settings controlled by the details .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process of the settings controlled by the details .
g@@ amma : controls the toler@@ ances of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more strongly rus@@ hed .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter@@ ing atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear fl@@ atter when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove h@@ iss and is the recommended method for this .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for soft signs with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft@@ ens and experiment with the smooth@@ ing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digi@@ ti@@ zed images . the smooth@@ ing takes place along the image con@@ tours and thus preser@@ ves the content as it also makes the human eye .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ IM@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression from JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ ase ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image .
the buttons saving and loading make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ down .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were created with a scanner and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the Hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed using a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photographs as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the Dark Image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . they are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image section and the preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . after that , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a spac@@ ing of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera manually . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise imp@@ en@@ ity effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure range of today &apos;s film and color shades of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by law by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further adjustment of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 , . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction lo@@ wers the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er adjustment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners counter@@ ed to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , each geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually .
in general : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Parameter &apos; has the reverse sign of the parameter in general .
zoom : this value will scale the image size and result in a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correc@@ tions . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the t@@ anning or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best do this correction than all first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would appear apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the T@@ onn@@ - / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ form cutting from image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs , such as shots from the front , frame and picture , is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera manually you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared video of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ u.@@ org web page that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film grain and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add fil@@ ming , if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mix@@ es color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO figures generate a kind of au@@ ra in the peak lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug filter is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film material on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gran@@ ular sight particularly in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can cali@@ br@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to the control of the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . fl@@ atten the smooth@@ ing or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ d@@ iness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is lab@@ eled with ( 1 ) and the editor is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen for you to sket@@ ch .
there are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller cho@@ oses the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engra@@ ver shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter engra@@ ver is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important aspect of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray , mon@@ stro@@ us landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button shut@@ down .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom lens : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
movement bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear motion , z : B : a car or a train photograph@@ ing , camera .
soft@@ ening bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image soft@@ ly in the dark tones and strongly in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos or adding a warm and subtle light .
def@@ ensive sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image through random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel count .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button shut@@ down .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural your images a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows changing the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . to do so , use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that is free to stay . if you want to start the filter of ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right orientation due to mir@@ r@@ oring or turning . you will find the tools in the menu Trans@@ formers rotating or transforming mirrors .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ IM@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose transform@@ er@@ size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to counter the pixel . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ IM@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
maintain the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the original image aspect ratio is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is available , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
the buttons saving and loading are used precisely for this . every single st@@ utter@@ ing for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can last very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ down .
you can see below an example of photo blowing by magni@@ fying a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently @-@ run operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a picture you just need to create a rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drawing up the rec@@ tangle . you will then see this rec@@ tangle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo is cut off . this gives you a good overview like your photo after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rec@@ tangle . create a new rec@@ tangle by simply using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the Cut @-@ Cut button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save File in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is retained .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross format of the width is always assigned .
the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centi@@ meters , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right side of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
in the dialog box , you can set the area for cutting to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ lowing page ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the editing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ hes@@ ive help enable you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
harmonious Tri@@ angle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide rec@@ tangle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number is equal to the sum of their two numbers .
the golden center provides more fluid guides when you put together a picture . these aids are enum@@ er@@ ated below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos to your goal . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition performs the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to guide the golden spiral . it should be something that direc@@ ts the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . to place diagonal on these lines a static object can be released more dynam@@ ically .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the inter@@ section points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise .
the options Horizont@@ al mir@@ r@@ oring and mir@@ r@@ ored can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the color button you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences , you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the upper right .
to your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function transformation cutting out of image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . note , however , the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed region .
angle right above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed region .
angle left below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region .
angle right below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformation cutting out of the image processing .
the locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . this is not a rotation , the image is dist@@ orted . in other words , a rec@@ tangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformation sciss@@ ors .
sciss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the picture becomes a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two doses bearing twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after gradu@@ ation , the picture has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformation from image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; shows only files in formats that know . this happens by means of the file extension and a comparison of them with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the file in the image processing will be displayed . you can change this list of file extensions . in the configuration section , you can find more information on this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF to the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ plug ; in the configuration section you will find further information on how to use &amp; digi@@ plug modules .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports loading of shell images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ plug . with this you can see more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras you can see below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ plug ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ plug ; understands these formats and will therefore not display films or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; use &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program for playback .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo are in &amp; digi@@ plug ; contain . your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs , noise reduction , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture applied ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical divide without dup@@ licate . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected preview pane .
horizontal divi@@ des without dup@@ licate . the upper section displays the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the overall settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive navigation tool based on the Marble Mini@@ program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out zoom or hold it and move it . move it while you pull the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allet files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and select and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten @-@ Files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allet or search the folder after files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described below the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the An@@ m C@@ urs@@ or check box is activated under the color button , the color is inserted from the color table at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode of over@@ writing has been selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying , cutting , and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional colour name followed by a line @-@ ending character if a further color follows . if there are three numbers values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be added as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; gra@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graphic viewer ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ counts the graph and is represented in &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; -@@ component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from about 1000 verti@@ ces and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for representing the graph@@ s required . in detail :
the main window displays the open graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; without any argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom of the screen . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alto ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently in &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; loaded file was modified by another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ ima@@ viewer ; see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; open instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
during the program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . once again , you can save your choice as well as change it later .
you can also specify how the graph shall be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page are to be incorporated into this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a page distributed on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut shop page gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or leave the program every time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at any start afterwards .
the context menu , which is usually in a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered displays of directional graph@@ s . the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm generates a spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ iti@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tic , and includes a multiple grid for treating large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm adju@@ sts the no@@ des circular to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should print the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and print the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can &amp; eg ; modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ s ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . with this poin@@ ter , click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this item ( if any ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module can read images and provide tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports by the s@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
when you open the menu entry pictures , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default duc@@ al default values to select your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image using the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the scan button , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file &apos;s options . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by storing the image .
you can create scre@@ enshot once you have selected in the Imp@@ or@@ tier@@ en- &gt; Screen @-@ Picture ... menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen pictures :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the scre@@ enshot has been made , the dialog appears options of the target image with the options described above .

the module exp@@ orting to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a fli@@ ck@@ r server on the internet .
when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a to@@ ken . this is used for your authenti@@ fication . it is thus virtually your reference to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can log in with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will see the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exp@@ orting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started twice , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at the moment , you need write per@@ missions . the module currently does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the key word field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can set the per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before the upload , the photos will be changed in front of the upload in size . the size is taken out of the value registered for maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . ge@@ ographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and latitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ relation . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . this file naturally contains data that were recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation indicates a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation under it , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the shown map . select the region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Char@@ ge this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a Picture Gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you don &apos;t need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the sample preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page is opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , containing everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which naturally affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab shows you some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if error occurred during generation . the web browser is automatically started in the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of color information . this can be found in PNG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the m@@ peg en@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first , you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can start the module using Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list .
after you &apos;re satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you are planning to reproduce the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high on the other hand very smooth picture changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind as soon as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start generating the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer , you can quickly or in all tranqu@@ ill@@ ity go a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a note appears that code or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings right below .
the printer assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together into standard photo prints . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing g@@ im@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or PP@@ M .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the main parameters like g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your images often or later on , you should not select the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and PP@@ M are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion button with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it to cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to re@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or increase the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen size .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
print preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have launched the module , the images window will be displayed with the pictures you selected . you can add more images using the button images . for the last selected image , a preview on the right side is displayed .
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images you will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you select are attached as attachments .
don &apos;t pay too many pictures at once . most email accounts have restrictions for the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . their configuration is stored and re @-@ used every time you change them .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the email .
the PNG format in the picture file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in images file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ am data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is done , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , searching for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . you can close this window with the button closure .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ chro@@ au a window with questions how to display your slideshow appears . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL option in the presentation option enables very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
the time distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between the images cho@@ oses another effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn it on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the desktop .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these browsers , see image . as you can see through a comparison with the image , now in any group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords entries are present .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images shown on which both people are visible are displayed . this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view with preview images to view the pictures of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined for yourself . see the picture .
in order to display images next to the names , select the button on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you will need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual . to do this , you need to open the Picture An@@ chor window ( in detail ) and display in the context menu the entry categories editor . in the Check window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor to your wishes , selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you visit the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can look at this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date may be either a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can search all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here , pictures where Jes@@ per but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but prefer to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the scre@@ en@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; Photo album ; and in the first dialog choose the demo if you start &amp; go photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select from the menu Help the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you would like to print this manual , you can find it on the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a co@@ hes@@ ive HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says , this bar displays date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries thumb@@ nail view from the database ( when you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview array ) and also the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of tim@@ eline , holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select a area , you will only view images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built @-@ in version that you can create through the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in .
last , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download any more images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to see an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
for all your HTML files , select a root folder and select a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder you need to manually copy them there . for the import function , see , properly functioning you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three related to base folders and UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub @-@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are coming together on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent much time applying the image information to persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ album ; this work does not even do once .
with Photo@@ Album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file , which can import others to your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file , or whether there is only a link to images in the file . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can share all the pictures and pass this file independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file scans the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files will be brow@@ sed . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by using the HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , the dialog for exp@@ orting images is described , which you can call through the File Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is about internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available to you :
when you copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Autom@@ atically close the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file import ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported base will import as described in .
the Wiz@@ ard to Import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you specify the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named with your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and what categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) set up the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the brow@@ sing and pres@@ tige , right up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures , but it was expanded and today your videos are also taking care of . in many places in this manual you talk about images , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the index@@ .x@@ ml file in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your pictures are stored and used it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; Photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
go to a window with which you can modify the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User Manual , the different settings will be explained .
to the left , you can see six different icons with which you can view settings of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can specify different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
click on the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group en@@ list rather than all groups of a member as explained in the dialog .
in the list below , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface .
the modules can be inv@@ oked via the Module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page , which you can access via the module yourself .
since the modules are used by several applications each other , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules work with &amp; photo@@ album ; not function . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications arrange their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order after albums for some modules to enable you to use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
simul@@ ating &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album that simply matches the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album &amp; photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &amp; Photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category persons , for example , will &amp; photo@@ album ; so do so , whether you would have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are not compatible with Photo@@ Album , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the module you want to load .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you can browse your picture database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all available pictures .
one of the main functions of Photo@@ Album is the ability to ann@@ ot@@ ate any image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons in the picture where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ sing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of Photo@@ Album ; since you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to susp@@ end images within the list : if you have for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are m@@ apped , you can , so that the names used up are moved up , find the persons faster and assign them .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the S@@ orting icon by date on the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and comment on these images . in this case , simply click on the button before and back buttons , which are on the top of the image to the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at a time with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window that shows the US as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special icon will be displayed .
in the context menu of the ann@@ otation , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and p@@ anning the bars that form the top of the frame . you can also create a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... that offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also om@@ it a frame completely . if you want to see this window later , use the button Options ... and then hide / hide the window . this can be seen in the picture .
when you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , to configure . just try it .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be shown in the image viewer . if you do not yet open a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Rem@@ ove button or select Edit selection in the Edit menu . now , the window will display that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the pictures without storing it on your hard disk . of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures in which the right upper corner is truncated , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy and re @-@ paste files from the folders . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support you until now you don &apos;t need to ask for the inser@@ tion of the CD . so , if you want to avoid anno@@ ying your pictures , please buy a larger hard disk to save all the images on it .
in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those you want to make in@@ accessible for others and click on Current View locking in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu entry Every@@ thing except current view .
so you have set up which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry pictures , which will hide all the images you have locked . if you want to see the pictures again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the Privacy menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on one hand , all images can be accessed on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the index@@ .x@@ ml file can read out or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to ob@@ struct the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; photo@@ album ; it has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it made , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily pull it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see matching entries to this page . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images by Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl + Plus or minus keys .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out . for the zoom @-@ zoom , you can simply pull a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom out the Plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rec@@ tangle is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the right button , the zo@@ oms set the zoom , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this doesn &apos;t work for videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
when you look at images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can cancel the picture and open configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you view one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this you can see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available to you in the browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have chosen , just add all of your notes . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and especially features can be displayed in preview screen . if you can view categories in the preview screen , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database .
in , you can see a picture on which was painted . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; to work , you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire @-@ mode views .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ object of an already selected object , as all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar , or select a menu entry in the menu Insert .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop down menu will appear , so that you can select the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the Edit menu bar , or right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take over those changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and then re @-@ click on users or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local .
the scre@@ enshot shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross will appear in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level of the scene in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it in any way . you can also store multiple windows and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , pull the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map of the map on the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views which are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , pull the starter on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the starter bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the gro@@ in strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view allows you to save window ordering ... save . it displays a dialog in which you can store the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar , or select the menu entry view .
a render mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality .
when you hit the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , select the following dialog :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but it makes sense to be a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the cross section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the Quality of Com@@ bin@@ ation , you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam each pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel in the display . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . in general , pictures with this feature are better off .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixels with inclusion . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continuously divided further and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion allows you to adjust the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature .
on this map you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for it here .
to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the full command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when error messages or warnings appear when import@@ ing , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray . this adds the source code to the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can also insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation on the displayed object . place the path to your document and the version here . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 are supported .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height area data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type license plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and turns .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects like the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail tru@@ ths for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to render .
when you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a bottom is ri@@ dden beneath the objects . the bottom is shown in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold . in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di , you can find more information about the parameters .
on this page , you can change existing windows or create new window @-@ orders . in the window ordering section , it explains how to create and store windows .
the standard window arrangement module : displays all existing window systems . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window rank@@ ings display all existing window rank@@ ings . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window ordering . new views can be created by button Add and Del@@ ete selected views with the button .
the position of the new window . with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten , Fix a map view along with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , very popular among beginners : a sphere on a level .
but you should carefully note the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ lessly , see &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er for the first start ; the following pre @-@ set window ordering :
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu .
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera has control points in the view , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the user button or the En@@ ter button , the wi@@ re@@ box views and the object tree instantly change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert the final body square ) and set the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to resolve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or En@@ ter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ box view also displays the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub @-@ object . the pig@@ ment will then change in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you can see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the pig@@ ment preview only shows a matt black material because you need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview . also , there are many possibilities again , but now take the simpl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the he@@ aders and bul@@ let in the preview , just click the Apply button and then get the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Solid Color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , each time you choose one @-@ colored and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should already be done simply because you should have understood the basic work method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have already understood it . the ball can be created just as simple as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input key or the button Apply ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down .
of course , rendering is now a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the bul@@ let , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on Ball Pig@@ ment , then choose Mon@@ och@@ rome and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values like in the following scre@@ en@@ shots and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
the brightness @-@ effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
ra@@ y@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a render method to produce a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you play a scene , the ren@@ derer will shoot hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any changes in the scene .
repeat the last commands to be revers@@ ed . you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit Com@@ pati@@ bility .
save the current window ordering and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or re@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a dump @-@ map is a way to pre@@ clu@@ de rough surfaces without ne@@ eding to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a dump @-@ map as well as a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base using an image file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file type , just type the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in the dialogue setting - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows .
if this is selected , then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving , open the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in win@@ dow@@ mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; set up so that only some of the file types can be displayed which can display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines if the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is ab@@ orted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the input field .
change the short@@ cut for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part View of the File System ( a window for the sub @-@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .

reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first signs of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . &amp; show@@ picture ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; show@@ picture ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ casing ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ picture ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all necessary information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photos ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ casing ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photos ; .
&amp; show@@ casing ; attempts to give you so much control over its operations as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to access these settings , you need to set up settings in the Settings menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicators section , you can select the color displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should contrast the colors with what you are supposed to display . exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ casing ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ana ) does not treat these options especially .
to scan a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
in order to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit in the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if Before saving a preview display in the settings selected , then the image will be shown in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the name of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically store it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option saving without asking for a file name . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that every time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for storing . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE support with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to finish .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . below you can set up a list of short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Global Key@@ note ... selecting with the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... Cho@@ ose .
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &quot; Amar@@ ok ; &quot; short commands . this makes your keyboard simpler and Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all needed modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates directory you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly notice that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to run external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is mostly used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send al@@ er@@ ts to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default scripts of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond appropriately to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure De@@ sts the script to display the setup dialog . in order to store and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now use D@@ CO@@ P functions to retri@@ eve further information about the new piece ( e.g. metadata or piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ atic paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ atic are also passed , so that the script can use the menu item d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ ress@@ Tools Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ atic ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok script administration can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name like e.g. my@@ sq@@ l.@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the initi@@ alization amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script pack@@ ets right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is finished , you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the W@@ iki script side of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music to the play@@ list rather than getting through endless menus . maybe you just search for a specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which ones you want to listen to ? then the play@@ list browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the compile @-@ time point with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . for details , see the System Requi@@ rements section .
activ@@ ates debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any trouble over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the play@@ list , the player window will switch to the play@@ list . if the option is off , only the play@@ list window will be displayed .
use tuning bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tun@@ er ergometer .
custom@@ iz@@ able : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ de@@ bar . thus , the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer is altered .
copy voice files to the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save play@@ list when moving , save the current play@@ list when you stop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when moving .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
make updates visible when changing the piece , so that the play@@ list window will roll up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when changing items to context browsers automatically switch to the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can adjust the App@@ ear@@ ance &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s App@@ ear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting custom fon@@ ts , the otherwise grey displayed section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ list windows , player window and context browser . press select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . to do this , use the color selection for front and background color .
re@@ play at the start means that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the start of the program , the playback will continue with the piece at the spot , with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
setting up on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be portra@@ yed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the input field Display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by typ@@ ing plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama users , allowing you to specify which screen in a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers still activate more settings in this map .
the Collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that is to be searched for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub @-@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. when added or deleted music files ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ .@@ and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added ren@@ ch@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ list browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l Device section is used to set the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : enter the computer on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is re@@ achable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card card provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call for similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . note : you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ en@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ Develop@@ er under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection go again .
most of the time , this is because tag@@ lib is crashing when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b @-@ Develop@@ er under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all libraries of &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when processing the met@@ a information .
if you use k@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable automatic turning off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically on a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many program files write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ Infos , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ petition / dynamic play@@ list ) always look active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click the status De@@ activated in grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you need to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ k@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ k@@ app : Un@@ defined Symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to custom@@ ize the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter there only one error , if you find something about the recovery of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty play@@ list .
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ up window has been converted to the statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the play@@ list . click on the title bar of the play@@ list and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the review for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press release on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select from the play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , next to the Add button , the button play@@ list is stored . click on it .
you probably don &apos;t have the x@@ mms @-@ config program . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach so the actual question must be : which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps you will use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include MP3 declar@@ ations ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter aste
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s as : - )
when you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously em@@ it audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. , sink ) .
G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Code@@ cs that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this error report . magni@@ fying the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc can also help well .
either you do not use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ am@@ ers react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . follow the regi@@ sters to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download open m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the command @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report on bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken by the gentle tones of music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to read the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ us@@ name Amar@@ ok player now@@ ad@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right Mouse Button puts a piece in the click sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing En@@ ter key after searching in the play@@ list , the first search result is played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tri@@ cky features , but how does the icon in the system section of the control bar look like ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to display .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collecting database can &apos;t be created and there are many error messages appearing on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to link to a local drive , or use Amar@@ ok MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading switch to wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired target folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece by yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ list window . then you can change the app@@ rais@@ al of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select the app@@ rais@@ al or edit the app@@ rais@@ al .
the developers don &apos;t want you to show you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find anno@@ ying . disable the option icon while playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings Tool@@ bars ... and take the required changes .

audio cro@@ bb@@ ler is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio cro@@ bb@@ ler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old versions of AL@@ SA have a lot of cr@@ ashes and a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine has not compiled these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re @-@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
if G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer CR@@ ITI@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without using P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I receive the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator regi@@ sters . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us b @-@ audio
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable tick bit@@ map support m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may of course take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed tut@@ or for Arts : )
listening to music should be very simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard that will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wiz@@ ard , this Quick Start Guide will help you . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a play@@ list is very easy . drag entries from the collection browser into the play@@ list . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the play@@ list , you can save it with the help of the button play@@ list . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the play@@ list browser . if the play@@ list is included in your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a play@@ list , you will find different ways to load the play@@ list .
to play an audio CD , please select audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD tracks in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files into the play@@ list and then press the Play@@ back button .
the audio CD feature uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function also exists in the play@@ list . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have here various ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required pack@@ ets are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with Amar@@ ok .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features .
in this chapter , it explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and play@@ list .
the player window is your one click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window is a running tex@@ tual display that displays the current piece or the current stream . a click on this area changes the display of the already ex@@ pi@@ red playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlarged window .
under the ga@@ it display , the PL and EQ buttons are also located . the PL knob is activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ list window while the button EQ is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ der to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous track .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the Main Menu or click the button EQ in the player window . once you activate the check@@ box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced play@@ list for all &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that there is no other player . but don &apos;t let the ple@@ th@@ ora of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area you can find some of the excellent play@@ list features , such as the context browser . on the right , you find the play@@ list itself . the play@@ list is easy to use and yet powerful enough even for advanced users .
the context @-@ browser shows different information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows will be explained later in detail .
if you have earlier used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the start window is off . the information presented there are now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information in the Statisti@@ c window can be viewed ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ter and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to em@@ ulate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you &apos;ll find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you &apos;ll see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set what information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to begin playback immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the play@@ list from the context menu .
in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . once you click the text sub@@ window , try and download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the edited version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button searches a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below is another division after the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name will be related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - Your songs are first sorted by genre and , among them , artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folder . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
directly below the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section of the play@@ list in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection field , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you get the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current play@@ list and adds the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order .
attach to play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will then be played next .
save as a play@@ list ... - Save the selected pieces as a play@@ list . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the media player queu@@ e for a long time . for more details , see the Media Player Browser section .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - Dad@@ dy will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Mo@@ ve files in the tr@@ ash ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation , select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under various interpre@@ ters .
highlight compilation - Chan@@ ges as a compilation of selected albums back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown under various interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ list browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new Smart Play@@ list . there , you can enter all the required criteria for your new play@@ list .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , it must be embedded in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpre@@ ter in the top list view of the Media Player Browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the play@@ list and drop them on the list interpre@@ ter . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be up@@ loaded to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , stop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and lo@@ osen the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search area that allows you to search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because all files are hidden in the file list , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you type tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the play@@ list .
if the play@@ list is longer than is in the window , the attachments of files can be difficult by simply falling down . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be useful : thus , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the play@@ list contains all the pieces that you want to play . you can change the order by simply inser@@ ting the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter letters there , only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separate search words separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms , search for entries that either contain one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries like Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : app@@ rais@@ al : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this looks for all pieces containing either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the entries then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played .
the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list is located at the bottom of the play@@ list . it contains buttons for some features of the play@@ list . on the left , you can find the Add button with which you can add the play@@ list pieces . to the right , you will find the play@@ list , empty play@@ list , and Rand@@ om M@@ ic .
next , the buttons next follow and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the play@@ list .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as you see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s configuration .
there are many other buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example , play control and volume control . you can set up the buttons that are displayed by clicking on the menu and clicking on tool@@ bars .
the Status Bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the play@@ list . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking with the mouse into the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the play@@ list on the menu .
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover pictures . you can launch it by selecting actions cover @-@ management in the collection browser .
the cover @-@ management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from :
the queu@@ e administration got your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the play@@ list . after you have set a piece into the queu@@ e , the play@@ list will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
when you want to add a piece of the queu@@ e , select the piece in the play@@ list and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the play@@ list . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details for setting up this later ) .
fill your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio cro@@ pping ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic play@@ list to work .
double click on the play@@ list you want , drag it to the play@@ list window , or click with the right mouse button and then select a load . in this way , your current play@@ list will be replaced with the new one . you should save the old play@@ list under certain circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix instantly fill your play@@ list and you can start playing right away . the play@@ list Emp@@ Fli@@ gest@@ ed Pi@@ eces begin with an empty play@@ list and you need to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of play , so your play@@ list will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , enable the latest dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as a starting point . the dynamic mode can be de@@ activated via the same menu entry .
the New button re@@ fills the current play@@ list and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the settings .
by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog to edit the play@@ list settings opens .
enter here any name for the play@@ list . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a double in this play@@ list . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed using the play@@ list settings .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the play@@ list . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces you want to add to the play@@ list after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the play@@ list will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right side have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one play@@ list , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by installing the script . it will open a selection dialog in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . to do so , use the button More Scrip@@ ts .
if you no longer wish to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then deinst@@ all .
if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ aliz@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug @-@ ins . to use a plug@@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start Guide will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps you need to have a loud installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will get worse quality when re @-@ coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start Guide shall show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . in order to understand the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , Cop@@ y CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you &apos;ve made all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , please press the Start button . you &apos;ll see a dialogue that looks like this :
in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original image is read into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; and adds , and adds these functions . therefore &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional audio @-@ coding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ code w@@ ma files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X audio en@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for the video processing . you will need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super Video CDs .
Norm@@ alize : this tool is used to custom@@ ize the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the uns@@ atis@@ factory effect that the pieces of music can be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically play all the videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed with which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as you would call for every single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , as if you would have called for any project file .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project it is asked what should be done , as if you had called file closure .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
open the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make a lot of project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is this ? support ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create only one image from a CD which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . alternatively , you can also create only one image from a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying the DVD , so the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you to a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then instantly be burned by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you to a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , coding settings and even options to modify the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . when an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view will display an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content will appear in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD folder in the folder view .
the header is a nar@@ ro@@ wer section , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header does not have any real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to modify the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the commands available in the upper section , you can adjust the mapping process to the bottom .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wiz@@ ard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function at startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alising and fine @-@ tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the range of functions , so your taste and the way of your task are dec@@ isi@@ vely displayed , which of the included programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all have in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ ref cre@@ ate@@ Audio@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternati@@ vely you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project obtained via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ string parent ) void r@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String ne@@ wn@@ ame ) void set@@ Vol@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id ) void )
with this , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT soft@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; select for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily record audio CD ; s output and stored in MP3 or OGG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many co@@ dec that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compression ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( these codes must still be added from the Linux distribution ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other en@@ co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about en@@ co@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read audio data from the CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection . in any case &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; even do not b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD will be explained later . this will result ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ ver programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , and everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the site step by step example , there are further information on how this program is used , as well as scre@@ en@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setting of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an en@@ coder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup directory - the en@@ coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . it must be noted that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected for coding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
open the setup dialog to configure the kind of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , sp@@ ep@@ ts ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main direction dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , en@@ coder setting ) , you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , en@@ co@@ ders and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can return these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by compressed data depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important as both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing og@@ g playback devices is available .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB flash drive , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto hi @-@ fi systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information manually entered or fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the coding utility to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ coding explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add title to keywords when MP@@ 3s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters needed ( = button title in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the calcul@@ ator . it must be noted that only text is talked about : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( editor &apos;s note : with this the author is meant ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being har@@ med by the CD ; however , the information without the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither artist nor the music business can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained from a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is actively a check box to choose ( sending an address ) . for using fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the progra@@ mmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org delivers a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the entire database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this is not yet done .
to save the read WAV files , the en@@ coder and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the en@@ coder . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . more information on en@@ co@@ ders are in the chapter Expl@@ ore Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a en@@ coder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . in doing so , &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed en@@ coder .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read genuine on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio en@@ coder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission for it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it by using the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each reading and CD .
here we determine the code to be used for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change them at any read of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name will be passed to the read@@ out program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a view into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
here there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be loaded / typ@@ ed as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
just select in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected with the Internet during reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection field is simpler , becomes a &amp; CD ; record found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag records , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , this is about 620 Mb , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . set it as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work first .
both function as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls confirm the 88@@ 80 protocol by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to provide any &amp; CD ; send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take over the settings of the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; after reading out the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; to throw out at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something has to be blin@@ ded to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to limit the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can also be deleted when needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic set of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section , a connection to the Internet is described and set up . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , as we are comfortable and want to pick up the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ;
since we use a CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the scre@@ en@@ shots look a little different from those fet@@ ched for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this isn &apos;t done yet , now the &amp; CD must be pushed into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search in the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers to Help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you haven &apos;t selected the check box for automatic selection of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Update Title &apos; unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece .
the lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following scre@@ enshot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( for example , whether all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters in the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
Tags are not supported by all the en@@ coding / file formats . see the code to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t transmit the CD ; data anyway . for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , return to the main window . just click on the line with the second slice .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the actual piece . the title of the piece is definitely and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown on the piece list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or select the All Pi@@ eces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
when selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection button , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left top half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is currently read on the disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see you when you try to work with a co@@ cker you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully codi@@ fied are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read out and code .
now the last title is read while another piece is coded and a third order is placed in the queu@@ e of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window is displayed .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; today , you can talk to CV@@ S as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls up many different programs has many variations of settings . the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays scre@@ enshot of the different map of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still reading it ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the initial start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this sort of empty screen ( especially if at the time of program starts there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? if you read this , you probably started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; may it do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agre@@ es with this proposal .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ oke Player of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics also some features other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US maps . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop to drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; end during playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid window . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the record from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator .
when you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the template and thus change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , so stops playing . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text , others use lyrics exter@@ ity and again others . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - )
in &amp; mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type automatically determines which one song is used , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the Kara@@ oke text entry . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select text and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are played in the series . in this section , you &apos;ll find how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection at the point Organ@@ izing .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the respective preferences in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember this when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . it again appears in the file dialog , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece when opened ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) is automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic added to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the open pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub @-@ menu of the menu selection , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the Kara@@ oke Text .
to ski@@ p a song , select the button Next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to ski@@ p back a song , select the knob of the previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map is transl@@ ating General MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all of the change patch to B@@ right Piano events into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , making a trumpet sound whenever a piano originally was to play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary that each occurrence has different tex@@ ti@@ des ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END define key@@ map &quot; Name der key@@ map &quot; ... END define key@@ map &quot; An additional key@@ map &quot; END OF CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TIONS ... END
you see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , you indicate how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard . the general use is as follows :
please note that the left side of the recti@@ fier is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patch is in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and also leave blank lines for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place all sounds that this instrument takes on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a ri@@ fle shot . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the always identical drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify sounds on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used primarily to map notes to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , just make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
N is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will naturally continue to be defined in the file name ! if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x will be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in what ratio pitch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch B@@ ender event with the value n , this is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard that will play a pitch B@@ ender event is to play a pitch higher with the value 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones higher up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the Di@@ alogue MIDI settings . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . the view select in the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have the control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support it has to be compiled . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
dis@@ agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; open on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or go ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) . in this way , I have to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so adjust the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Malaga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I do not have much spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as a hobby I have program , collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a lot of joy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kara@@ oke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will include ( if you want it ) . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my free time and won &apos;t give anyone money for it . I would like to point out that I &apos;m just going to progra@@ mmer , because / if I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of A@@ WE @-@ cards was too high .

additionally it can be found on his homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view pictures . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using a FM device or an A@@ WE Card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to compile &amp; mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; is a simple interface for MP@@ layer , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from MP@@ layer or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE Website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the play@@ list . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played down , you should use the Perman@@ ent Play@@ list Category .
of course , you can add groups to groups in order to get an additional hierarchy level . when you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the selected entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , television and permanent play@@ list can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / directory can be edited by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you need to select the same play@@ list from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same with the play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ d option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically stop by opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / auto ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing MP@@ layer in the Con@@ figuration dialog by &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; here you can set the path from the MP@@ layer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ MP@@ layer . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like the setup of the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
to allow the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; module must be specified as a service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if no errors occur here , the Back@@ end Output within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to ensure that a pre @-@ given back@@ end is taken for a certain m@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should return all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can play from TV cards , either by MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the K@@ MP@@ layer , the dialog can be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the en@@ coding must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it .
because the V@@ DR support of K@@ MP@@ layer can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presum@@ ably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by K@@ MP@@ layer for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ version , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as root after the device is connected . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for their performance each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will test the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and networking support .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . Unix @-@ like systems are likely to rely on the package &amp; text live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux ; distribution . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; c@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the c@@ ile ; website .
this manual is for everyone regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the k@@ ile ; website should be established .
if you have any questions or when comp@@ iling &amp; c@@ ile ; on or if extensions wish , this should be addressed at the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; C@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex environment for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; C@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management need to be called .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to learn about its possibilities the manual should be consul@@ ted with K@@ ate . users of &amp; c@@ ile ; can start there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , use a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it is derived from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
in order to be able to correctly control , good books should be used , e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , which begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again using the \ \ end { document } command .
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard of &amp; C@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; selecting the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers some options for creating the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
document classes : this is the type of document to be created : articles ( items ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
coding : with this , the drawing en@@ coding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is simply a short description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section .
&amp; C@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( and the in@@ appropriate ) . if you want to see more beautiful areas of a green text on the screen , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed .
with the automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to merge the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , the back search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI file ; file &#91; rendered independent file ) &#93; has been created , navig@@ ating &amp; c@@ ile ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and other information such as the font and is next to PDF the output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , convert and print DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are bound to the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the corresponding section will jump to the corresponding section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text , it will be j@@ umped to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick assembly : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is opened to Ã © n@@ der@@ ungen@@ â to the Ã ¼ ber@@ wach@@ t@@ â , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after rapid construction .
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for the quick inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; instructions for the sub@@ division are :
the choice box Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
designation : with this command , a term for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection on a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary settings appears . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
the last selection field named Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size . the fon@@ ts can be set for the main text , the marks , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; c@@ ile , there are two options available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up with the hand .
the brackets after the \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class command contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the fon@@ ts . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is using the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or Kn@@ op@@ fs Quick @-@ bau .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; c@@ ile ; automatically removes the storage .
if the document fails , it should be searched for errors in the logging process . if fast construction should be started &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font name . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } also allows to outline the fon@@ ts within the environment .
the changes are only covered within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . you can , for example , add certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for cur@@ sive printing and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed in it@@ ali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text was presented with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; sign language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide is now followed for creating a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; .
once in the wiz@@ ard a bit of text was entered , some adjustments should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , at least one quote , some places in fat and cur@@ sive printing and a poem can be used to see the differences in these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) . in case of an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it out and have fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI , file , the same steps are necessary for creating the document ( see ) . in the 7th step , after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) by printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the search engine allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; C@@ ile ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; files . to do this , only Modern can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... tools building can be selected .
to complete the search @-@ search , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on pre@@ text search . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document by &amp; k@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line .
if there is no error in using fast assembly of the &amp; DVI , there may be an error . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the Log@@ ging file or in the message box .
the logging file identi@@ fies the source of errors in the source code . in the editor , the buttons can then be used in the source code of La@@ Te@@ X error and most La@@ Te@@ X error in the editor . to view the wrong line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the wrong line .
once the corresponding button is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can be re @-@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard can be used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section .
advanced users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by scanning an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... General settings are set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is replaced by the entry in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps are completed :
when creating a new document , the own template can then be selected instead of the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . if an easy way to create a template is searched , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; kate ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; kate ; can be done directly in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; Xen@@ ical ; and to learn about its abilities the manual can be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; c@@ ile ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; C@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in &amp; lat@@ ex ; they can be used as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that clicking on \ \ par from \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p will only be \ \ par .
when pulling the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; C@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can capture additional boun@@ ce marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu item Edit Spr@@ ung@@ ers or the corresponding key symbol enable the jump to the next or last jump to@@ ken . this is also highlighted in the case of the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the key aspects of using a program such as &amp; c@@ ile ; although &amp; kate ; already offers outstanding features , have been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is always supported . under Edit Select the following commands are included in the text selection :
this extended significance includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only bending thing in &amp; c@@ ile ; is that the separation is separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also applies &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back@@ war@@ ping partition ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for listening to a part of the document , it can be selected first and by pressing the Del key . &amp; kate ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; # By removal , the following commands are included for the text of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has been suggested that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; c@@ ile ; for more commands under Edi@@ ting Environment for possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to protect the surroundings .
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview of the environment can quickly be lost . this command complet@@ es the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure is not destroyed .
&amp; C@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to the editing environment .
this command j@@ umped at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command j@@ umped at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the cur@@ led clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , the other end of the group is spra@@ yed ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many ne@@ sted cur@@ ly cur@@ ly brackets , the overview can quickly be lost . this command complet@@ es the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used as a link . for the beneficial implementation it is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; the character is &quot; used for two simple designation . &quot; and for the end of the application , the character is &quot; used . &quot;
this automatic double @-@ stop sign can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used to specify specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and therefore German or French quot@@ ation marks . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting from Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; k@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; k@@ ile ; not just a line break but at the same time the \ \ item command .
within a spread@@ sheet environment , close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be found under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users would like to arrange columns in tables -@@ surroundings and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; try to make this possible . when using Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; k@@ ile ; after the next tab in the current line .
although &amp; kate ; already a good source code completion , it has been added in &amp; c@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) it has been added . three of them work according to demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation ...
when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
at the back of the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and may be dil@@ uted by the completion list . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , boun@@ ce brands can be frozen so that an easy jump to these positions is possible with Edit Spr@@ ung@@ brands N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste spr@@ int marker is possible and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
settings c@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different kinds of preferences for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands and utilities of the general language used .
command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ begin and the completion mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of the environments .
when inv@@ oking a complete environment or the Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient noise can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is executed .
setting up , setting up ... k@@ ile ; adjustments can be made to these lists . this mode uses the option list of complete recovery mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands .
&amp; C@@ ile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of cuts that are immediately replaced by long strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... tile files can be set up . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is introduced over the volume , or the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large doors are not helpful for automatic complet@@ eness . however , it has been established that many users in one document are written more than once . this provides &amp; c@@ ile ; the completion for all already written users .
this mode can be set up in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Settings K@@ ile ... tile exp@@ and@@ able . here you can also set the tres@@ hold for the display of completion .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the personal home folder .
the dialogue charts are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be highlighted .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the changes and re@@ orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ ordered with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted using ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to assess the outcome of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed together in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard input Alt ; 2 . then , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file in a PS file and be watched by old ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick @-@ Engineering command , a viewer is usually called after the compilation . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will pop up every time .
a new project is being conducted over the Men@@ Ã ¼ ube project .... This includes the following information for the project :

the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered over scripts in vertical bars .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; c@@ ile .

this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; tile ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help , &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k on , containing a database with all of the available documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or stro@@ kes . from &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is derived from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can design your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature is derived from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day you use different signatures , as in case of random signatures , you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . in this way , you will receive one lt ; empty Sig@@ natures ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natures ; and add your new signature in the bottom section .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use emails private or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File Menu , or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ov@@ ing in the tool@@ bar .
this allows you to select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click on the User Interface button and enter the new short command by pressing the button or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ code ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 Ne@@ ed . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or any other program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de @-@ documentation knows well and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application requires a index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the tissue folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of the current working folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de @-@ documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical interface for this .
if the just opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
when it comes to output on the screen , its file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then they just drop the current file . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to be checked by means of other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is formed , click the Well @-@ formed Review selection .
to use an &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema as well as for the Relax@@ NG test is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then simply select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection .
specify the name of the file , as the result should have been named , the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ stly , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can &apos;t wait from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug@@ in or a part , we begin with the Edit menu menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage all of the plug@@ ins included and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . if you add plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project multiple people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the indication of team members and they can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialogue .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for clear identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member out of the list and selecting the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold to which they are : text .
nick@@ names and your own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on notes .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leader when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is happening in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that enters the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
insert notes is easy . either the comment entry can be selected from the Editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word can be entered in a comment field followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the pointed nick@@ name of the team member , is part of the project as part of the area and sub @-@ project leaders , as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta setting ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with regard to tags including car completion can be changed .
big / Small @-@ write of tags : big / ump@@ y of automatically entered tags . normal / lower case means the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically entered attributes . normal / lower case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional Tags automatically close : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not automatically include optional tags : as above for all other tags , with the exception of simple tags .
automatically update start and end tag : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls automatic conversion of acc@@ ent characters into appropriate coding during ti@@ pping .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for the detection of different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the default specifications can be restored .
default character en@@ coding : the en@@ coding of newly created or otherwise opened as with file opening opened files ( where the en@@ coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a map ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the window settings on the default to the next start is useful when the user interface comes through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / dependen@@ cy of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the possibility of switching warnings by hooks of no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . regarding the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree displaying the picture of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible , which can be changed by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons triggered .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of knot@@ s in the tree can be set automatically when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document .
ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are the third party applications that can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug@@ in , if it is not at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
loading Compon@@ ent in &quot; Read Only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses to load . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse to load if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , testing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the given information is correct . selecting allows saving the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubles@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as the support for the D@@ BG debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button Options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the debu@@ gger &apos;s supported features , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to debu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to debu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which needs a debu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be taken care of .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session starts the session . closes the connection to debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server in order to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
tells the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a request is started , the script will start with the request .
displays the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger takes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the debu@@ gger execute the next command in the script , where it is possible to get in functions and include error @-@ adjusted .
in@@ stru@@ cts the debu@@ gger to ski@@ p the instruction and go to the next as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can input a variable or set a new value to a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which can be found on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
document Type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folders and tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbol@@ ised bars of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for tag displays . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares that they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users may have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( family 2 only )
valid for class class only . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the class name where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
set a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an element type element .
returns the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editing dialog , and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface name and method name . the arguments passed to the method may be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current Tags .
a box tag summar@@ izes the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is an element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; are replaced .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; start window and select Tag@@ x@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , the check only occurs when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D processor DT@@ D settings . thus di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D ( / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set with settings actions ... are created . clicking New Action leads to the same dialog :
the button short@@ cut assigned to this action . with clicking the user defined button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs .
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script to find in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace the current document URL . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us process ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text will be unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods described above , a script can input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to receive the default input . in the input field input , you can determine what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , set to the default output .
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create their own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the Mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are quite self explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action knob at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we &amp; ki@@ p@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ p@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually set as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user is sign@@ alled that clicking on this symbol is &amp; lt ; start@@ r ; tag in the current document is inserted .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions to set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be shared for a better overview by some divi@@ ders into multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar to set the tool@@ bar for the tool@@ bar . make sure the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the divi@@ der supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ating all the symbols to ensure that everything works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after New XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) is loaded when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you prefer . therefore , this chapter describes how to create an &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory whether someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . then you have to create the doc@@ rc file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these docum@@ ent@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ ents Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 3.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 3.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 3.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 3.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in PHP , documentation such as :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and logical next to the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the range of the doc@@ rc file which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file lines .
a simple list of del@@ im@@ ited context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your file doc@@ rc and ad@@ here to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you indicated in your file doc@@ rc ) in the same folder as doc@@ rc and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ rc files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different locations there is an menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and in the script tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make a contribution we recommend signing the resources , for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New Resource must pass the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading tool@@ bars , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Scrip@@ ts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be ab@@ orted . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears stating the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages that are not currently supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creating a D@@ TE@@ P package can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Start menu and conversion a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target Name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions : the string that reads in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and understand the full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and projected . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used , available . by tool@@ bars about actions , all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to backup different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; samples up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Editor window , the architectural views , the map guides with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the card driver with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all card drivers , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or exec@@ uting CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area lead to another context menu concerning the edited document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , help the word under the mouse cur@@ sor or open the file , if the string under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor identi@@ fies a file .
at the top of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in various fields in a dialog .
the Bau@@ man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with learning flash@@ ers are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete files from the storage media can be done using the context menu displayed .
a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us work area . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script . using the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as to start , edit or send an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , many attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the application system , which is aligned with the content , allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two boxes at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this card driver displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this card driver shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to define .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other backup and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a full list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far along the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop , what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to expand as they need it for their need .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts text from the cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
enables you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; -@@ script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scrip@@ tac@@ tions and debu@@ gger .
out@@ going and switching the problem rep@@ orter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the icon column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents will appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project folder .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows , for example , to copy video files to your project folder or sub @-@ folders and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de , and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; managed the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects can be explained the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project dir / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be set by settings actions ... are added . tool@@ bars are stored on the tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this will not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , wherever everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / re@@ fresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be refres@@ hed from the D@@ TE@@ P without re@@ building the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . if this is global and is not present in the global K@@ DE folder , the store will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , in the Tags Menu there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu item , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or dis@@ ables the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar if this tag contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug@@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed in the menu items above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug@@ in will disable it .
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the date ; version .
very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ int@@ osh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate change@@ over between the different types of the user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes might need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . the map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a contract , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated .
activ@@ ates the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affect every application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you will find details .
a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or which you can add and modify the sequences .
this should generate a help according to the mouse poin@@ ter &apos;s environment , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self explan@@ atory and should be filled in the best way from above , since , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Tab .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can specify the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let &apos;s be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are supposed to be included . if a project is started from scratch , don &apos;t hook .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profile or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired debu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set with the button Options . in this case , troubles@@ hooting is described .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile &apos;s content , using a specific tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ windows project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project opens and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files can be found . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to progra@@ ming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on disk storage option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before the upload .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply sharing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project tool@@ bar , which can be accessed , opened or deleted by the Tool@@ bar Project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which you have the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best custom@@ iz@@ able via the Tool@@ bar menu . usage and Ad@@ dition vary . adding tool@@ bars will be treated below in the Add @-@ Tool@@ bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be set , which can be displayed in the dialog where the actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries action will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with settings ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are essential documents skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you set for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the Tem@@ plate tree is available .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . one makes a simple framework for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree among global templates . see for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area repeatedly in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl based . see for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree .
as the name says , these templates for full web sites serve as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure as you like ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template save as local template ...
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template save selected selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection may be dra@@ gged along with dra@@ gging and placing on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a default folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project files you can click on a folder on the right and create a site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved just as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically link with &amp; PHP ; create , paste or link with them . additionally , you can keep a lot of things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as the attributes are inherited .
if a root folder would be set , it would generally disable templates in this path except they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows prec@@ eded or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , and by copying contents to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have to use context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection to add folders , copy and paste from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that is accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the branch divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor functions as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back when needed to source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; it displays a small green symbol the default code of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP , it is still necessary to change the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes the active cur@@ sor from a window to the other , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta .... According to V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatic . in principle , the time span can be set automatically when selecting V@@ PL . basically , the recommendation applies : a small margin for fast computers and a large span for slow .
the document properties dialog is called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons down . a click into the list allows to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keywords key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS compliance with the buttons below the list . a change on the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cur@@ sor is used as in a word processor , moving with arrows . in rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using the back button or the remo@@ ver button .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way across the tool@@ bars as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags will not be removed , for example if an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the Table Wiz@@ ard or the Listen wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will later work in the V@@ PL ; function , in this release the tables or lists must be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet execution can be followed .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , do not need &amp; k@@ de ; nor libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file fil@@ en@@ ame with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . for example , a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a default named my@@ QNA@@ P@@ m or a specified module name is checked . &amp; eg ; template is consistent with any QNAP device that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud &quot; is expanded according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a fragmented holding point must be dis@@ b@@ anded for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are checked again shortly after the start of each run .

start a shell . then enter the &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; command &quot; help &quot; to get an overview of the help .
adds the parameter by name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ X ; and value &amp; lt ; VAL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables .
if --@@ repeat is twice equal , the conversion will run 100 times .
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for this has been activated in Lib@@ XML
activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document , if the support for this has been activated in Lib@@ XML . this is turned on as default
on systems with an installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can browse the arrow keys on / off by the c@@ aching of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite phrases as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a stop in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
path : a path to changing the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML @-@ data or the XML _ document edited by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ L@@ EN@@ AM@@ E@@ KG ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ Ds ;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly what I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time fixed the ind@@ entation at many places . another progra@@ mmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts while mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare text fast , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful if two persons work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen image shows three source files while mer@@ ging :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check co@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are shown visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease the typ@@ ing work by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder er@@ 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder er@@ 1 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder er@@ 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder folder
open dialog enables manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the open dialog notes your selection and displays it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders will be introduced . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the ab@@ ort button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes , a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , you in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can do nothing &amp; diff@@ use ; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then , a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color for that is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is good to see in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line divi@@ ding the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an info line with the in@@ scription Edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the Spr@@ inge buttons to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative windows are used , each difference at the same time is a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manually edit ; then , in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queu@@ e ; no row in the queu@@ e ; this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting sources ignor@@ ing the numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate the keyboard to the left , right , high , down , side up , start , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . the over@@ sight column next to the vertical image bar can also be used for navig@@ ating .
you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the inser@@ tion key , you can switch between insert mode and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ izing columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / first / last difference , to the next / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ picture backwards / C@@ trl image down@@ wards ) or to the next / last un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ paste ) . there is also the option selection automatically . if this is enabled , then whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copy the manual copying . however , be careful with this option , because you could over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
new@@ lines are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use the carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end@@ ings of the source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically when it is finished and restored at the next start . ( Menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered rendered . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically creates an un@@ just color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab sign is inserted .
when you press input or return , the previous line ind@@ entation is automatically used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , every selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board , and then manually copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can choose which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; , but then files with different sizes may look identical in page @-@ to @-@ side comparison though they are different .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even minor differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic expansion mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white marks are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are covered in the chapter for scanning folders and performing mer@@ ging . see Docum@@ entation for Com@@ par@@ ison and Com@@ bin@@ ation for details .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if you already have such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without any further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you have to restart &amp; restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
the selection fields for coding appears a short note of what the local en@@ coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you . )
custom@@ ize the file en@@ coding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to save is to be used .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to specify the coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . by selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . mer@@ ging current file in the merge menu will also work if you just compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut anno@@ ying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is passed to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users don &apos;t want to program it by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line devi@@ ation to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression of the text found on each string and in this context all characters are listed in one line . the \ \ U trans@@ forms the found text in upper@@ case .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line matching removes the possible keywords . you can change the list as needed . the \ \ before the $ is necessary because $ is a special character and the end of the line would mean .
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line compar@@ isons . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually er@@ ased .
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the re@@ plac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Aller@@ dings are different with per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that alters the text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programm@@ ers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively .
... makes for each object a suggestion for mer@@ ging ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and show the simul@@ ated changes without really performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message window on current progress . if you cancel the folder scan , only the files that were compared to that time are listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually shown folded . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories that you can open or fold .
when you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be noti@@ fied about problems of this kind .
as seen in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders , age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colours of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copying from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B ) : errors : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the syn@@ cing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised , then sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ def@@ 3 ; the necessary action to be followed after both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) is checked , then an error message appears : files are different but the date is identical . if such errors are not fixed , the merge of the folder cannot be started .
when mer@@ ging , a file is processed after the other . it shows the status column when mer@@ ging has been successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected arises . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is fine anywhere .
if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge either the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all matching actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then C is used as the target in the three @-@ folder merge mode , and B is selected as the target while the two @-@ folder merge mode is selected and when syn@@ cing , A and / or B will be used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the target folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select the folder merge / continue in the folder menu , or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merge actions by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types , a message appears to indicate the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and C@@ anc@@ el options .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( see the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select the folder merge to start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
when you make a mistake , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you ski@@ p the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before proce@@ eding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not be re@@ merged . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; Account Settings ... ) now has a section called Folder merge with these options :
only files matching the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be typ@@ ed more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this can be set to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a prec@@ urs@@ or stand@@ . a file is hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
in case of links to folders : when the option is disabled , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible recur@@ sions ) .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . )
if you compare large folders to a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution with caution .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . for example , this can be useful when copying the change date . please use caution when copying . this option is turned off in default .
activ@@ ates syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders .
if there are any differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is off @-@ default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ original If an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig -@@ extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of single files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally the folder merge view is visible during the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to launch the folder merge . you can also merge a single file directly , without first having to launch the folder merge . to do this , the status is set to first and the file will not be merged when you start the folder merge .
this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening that are on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be aware of :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . that is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # contains URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link will show a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date vary from the original . ( this is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP starts always the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then &amp; k@@ def@@ 3 ; the patch program will start to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when playing a part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in Part Mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s hot ) are already available . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that mer@@ ging can be like the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using G@@ PL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who went this way or going to go this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t have the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file , you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this kind is depend@@ ance but this cl@@ is often the case .
the editor not@@ ices every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too big so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c swe@@ eps ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ def@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ def@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see the RE@@ AD@@ ME file for more details .
da &amp; k@@ def@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) Cop@@ y to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ paste ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folders with the Update button . )
this also leads to the fact that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when they merge . if the target folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is turned off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or shift them . this works both within a working area as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; move . the movement is possible both within a working area and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and Finish . if however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , Work Desktop and End .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces .
when this field is crossed , the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is inter@@ sec@@ ted together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty work surfaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program window selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as known from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row , which is very good for representation on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and p@@ anning windows as symbols or with their content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , and set up sel@@ ections of switch ... lets the dialog appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must login as a user root or turn to your system administrator .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen resolution . you can use &amp; k@@ code to use a part of the screen , as if you would like to read a magni@@ fying glass for the print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is intended for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; its .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated to include new features . it is optimized for use on performance @-@ sensitive machines .
if you &amp; k@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fication window . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is herein@@ after referred to as a drop @-@ down window .
in the default setting , it increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag , to indicate a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default probe ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrows and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fication window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , press the &amp; Shift ; press key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; move the selection box .
with this combination you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains firm and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts or stops updating of the ad . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to be against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window appears . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; Autom@@ atically uses your introduced short commands to store files , open a new window , print , new@@ com@@ er ( with the button again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and size &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag also known as &amp; magni@@ fier ; is a screen resolution . you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; to use a screen area as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , if you suffer from pain that is related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
in order to clarify it once again , even if it helps to avoid pain caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the smart shift is activated , it makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it em@@ ulates the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can pull the pulling with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , exec@@ uting a mouse click .
if intel@@ li@@ gible shift is enabled , the shooting range is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the mouse button is shut down , the mouse button is closed again , if no moving of the mouse happens in the meantime .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking the mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . this movement is saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to sh@@ orten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there Sound System and here the tab General . there &apos;s a sli@@ der sound buffer that you set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
all settings are reset to the values that were set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings are reset to the stand@@ by after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off at first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later remove the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of what position a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that do not constitute a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d need to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute even a mouse click . her@@ eby , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible in this way to mark text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and re @-@ insert or execute any other action at which you want to move the mouse in pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this :
do not use the smart shift if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , simply select a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this means that every time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart shift starts using the delay time . later , you can use the smart shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test add @-@ on for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers , and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and the an@@ tigen of the bri@@ ghtest pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth &amp; mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to speak their computer for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first side of the wiz@@ ard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the Description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text passages book . from the text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) , you define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words will be included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clearly visible and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have a mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sentences in the input field that you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the process memory . you can select from these sentences that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog at &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output , and settings , page Wor@@ m@@ pling and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to inv@@ oke the language generator . in the field below the input field you specify the character en@@ coding which is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
using possible t@@ ts@@ d as a language service is used &amp; mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field Action after selecting a passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key short@@ cut or by selecting a passage in the text passages book menu or in the box for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Talk , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added to the inter@@ section memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered initially only in the input field .
with the second drop of the editing window for text passages , you can choose whether the text pass@@ code book should be automatically saved when closing the edit window .
when you select changes , the text pass@@ code book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ code book is to be saved .
the site Wor@@ ter Com@@ bin@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word @-@ crossing . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down field you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books , or export them to a file . below the list , you can select the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field below .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of text or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
you can add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar , or a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays or text passages can be changed by pulling the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the stream memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the stream memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the stream memory .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the menu bar via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with notes about the state of &amp; mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar is displayed for text pass@@ wor@@ ds with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly below the tool@@ bar via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
you probably have not entered the command for the speech output correctly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the language edition . ( see Settings dialog for Voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported , and the license allows to use festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ estyle directory . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option data must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more elaborate than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / DE@@ 1 / DE@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option data must be turned on as a default input .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use the option t@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog at &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t speak can be output text by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can re@@ charge over and over again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer , a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed .
for more detailed user documentation , help : / k@@ mouth ( either type this URL into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or address bar ; or start the help center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a service consisting of modules that allows each application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; to voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programm@@ ers , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities .
pre @-@ reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; kate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
speech output is performed using the speech speech schedul@@ er , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the generation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility .
in F@@ UT@@ URE : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d on t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browsers &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate , with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
before you can use the speech speech , you need to install the speech speech @-@ schedul@@ er and set it properly .
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the map card is displayed in general . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . a so @-@ composed combination of language , synthes@@ izer , voice , sex , volume and speed is called the speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the map sheet leader in t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card file spokes@@ man will appear . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top performer is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list below . the order of the speakers in the list is also their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ man on the board of cards appears . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost . go back to the map and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to start the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the map sheet orders to create and manage text jobs . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the Voice end system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map sheet in general to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS system . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map card will display jobs and you can create text jobs and read it . see . remove the marker , K@@ TT@@ SD will be stopped and the T@@ TS System by &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the Control Panel &apos;s system area , it disappears once the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , pause , pause , and re @-@ record text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card @-@ card orders are displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map map and check the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text you want to read , and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ he@@ aders and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; kate , the expanded text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text you want to read , and select text in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the mess@@ aging system of &amp; k@@ de ; that noti@@ fies you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read it .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up various types of messages ; for example , you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , you can be noti@@ fied when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the Settings menu Settings menu . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy vary depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags and b from the messages that K@@ mail sends , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required .
in filters text is edited before it is sent to the speech speech schedul@@ er . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the speech &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the sub@@ du@@ ed orders will be res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can chat with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you initiate from the card card is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of them reads , this output will stop and termin@@ ate .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ er@@ ts , messages and text orders as well as &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can still be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre @-@ defined list of strings that enable the creation of Chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; convers@@ ing ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understood form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have chosen a female voice on the board of cards , you can read the text of K@@ DE news about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is used for voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , a warning or a &amp; k@@ de message is sent , it is processed by all enabled filters installed on the page below . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the set @-@ up normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and the subsequent installation di@@ alogs are shown below .
if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbit@@ rar@@ ily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list of a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to view a list of languages .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs can be obtained using the q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only copy the copy .
the filter chan@@ ger filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box will apply this filter if matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison to words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can add it to the di@@ alogs adding or editing as help to compile these expressions .
&amp; XML ; translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such implement@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the Spe@@ aker Set filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker installed on the Board of Cards , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts , specify a text to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker characteristics , which pres@@ ets the program that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected by the Spe@@ aker select filter .
if there is a value here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it with one click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the selection filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box will apply this filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , which programm@@ ers can give T@@ TS capabilities to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the Voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . you can find the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output text via the &amp; d@@ bus interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open 2 &amp; Con@@ sole ; window . first run into a window , then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; de@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE works at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain notes or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only che@@ wing wav@@ e@@ forms . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure the option character en@@ coding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string filter . see .

the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE code archive , you can download the package via &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ts ; find the source code from ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
KT@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be launched on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . check the website of kt@@ ts ; , by information , which are not yet included in this manual .
the speech speech &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to bro@@ aden your use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source code archive for c@@ de@@ dness or have downloaded the tar@@ ball each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first whether speech schedul@@ er works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program t@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that the device is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat or cancel stat@@ e- or paragraph styles , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise it will automatically be selected the best fitting voice . if you want to learn more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; select a speaker , you will be looking for .
when you click Add Spo@@ kes@@ person on the Board of Cards , and in order to add a nar@@ r@@ ator to the list , or click Edit , the Card Card Spe@@ aker Set is displayed . for example , the installation of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character en@@ coding for text handed to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting will be performed automatically . generally speaking , western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 to use eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regulator and show this grey , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster with larger memory consumption .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear at the start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the icon t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited pro@@ position .
with the buttons in this row , you can forward or decline in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to view the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
text Or@@ ders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed here . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have AL@@ SA selected , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the microphone speed here . 50@@ ml ; % equivalent to half and 200 nbsp ; % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , select Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of speech applications :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the sub@@ du@@ ed orders are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room .
when a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a Screen Re@@ aders , it inserts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both audi@@ tory sounds and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for news , al@@ er@@ ts and screen readers when they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the Map Noti@@ fication appears .
select this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events from the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection box to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the properties of the requested speaker here . the default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the board speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voice , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . also , brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of the voice , for example ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice , the festival used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limit detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this can &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with pre @-@ reading , because only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set of rules recognition filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of rules recognition filters is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ position recognition filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to do this is to set up the speaker selection by selecting . switch on the Spe@@ aker &apos;s selection and select which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts . switch on the Spe@@ aker &apos;s selection , change some features and check how the choice of the speaker changes . you need to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the entire text block , which can last very long ,
if the speech synthes@@ izer doesn &apos;t support this function , you can pause or cancel jobs on the card charts .
for these reasons , the regular set detection filter is automatically set up when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only be removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and app@@ end a tab@@ ulation mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ulation marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set @-@ limit detection filter will retain the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the standard code detection filter from distortion , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c included in &amp; t@@ ts .
you can over@@ ride the Spe@@ aker &apos;s settings for the application on the menu card Spe@@ aker selection . the card card is displayed if
use of the default speaker ( the top one on board map speaker ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker that has all the characteristics of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; t@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select the speaker that best matches the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the subscri@@ ber you want . if this feature does not matter , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a primary attribute . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
in order to use all the properties in the nar@@ r@@ ator section , which is most likely to be deleted , click on the Def@@ ault button and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .

in order for this to work , the program must be installed and discover@@ able via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s like Festival Interactive offer themselves a setting for speed on the board map for speaker setup . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activation either the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ form filter , and set up the speaking speed .

the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) .
the default setting is &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example

before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you received using the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is dis@@ closed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you can find help in the manu@@ als supplied with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ x / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone for the voices . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) en@@ coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look at the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice sharing system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German lyrics di@@ phone .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the festival / lib / . instructions can be found under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for german &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you downloaded .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows managing the network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; for the user , create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ) module can be selected by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings are selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the hand selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and rel@@ e@@ ased . selecting non @-@ re @-@ requests can be made permanently . when the network settings are started , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray displayed , meaning the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system administrator mode , you can enter the system administrator mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , the whole module &apos;s functionality is available . it is divided into three riders :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the network interfaces :
the settings displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to be edited in the Di@@ alogue device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options .
with the selection Autom@@ atically , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the select manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface in the boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the list of devices .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
depending on the needs , network devices can be enabled or switched off . switching to a switched @-@ off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
depending on the needs , network devices can be enabled or switched off . switching an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
specify the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that medi@@ ates physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS tri@@ ggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator will allow you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . entries can be added to the list by selecting a single entry and listing or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons .
clicking the button Add ... from the batch calcul@@ ator to name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit Edit .
the list named calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name to IP address references to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of known computers contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still @-@ in @-@ test version of IP should replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... The New Alias dialog will display .
enter the name of the well known host@@ name and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple alias names , press the button to add multiple times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a name known to name from the list and select Edit ... The dialog Con@@ figur@@ ing Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . to activate the changes , you need to set the following command .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ bab@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , when &amp; k@@ de , and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical user interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool for their distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile net@@ work@@ .@@ conf . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second part all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; variable configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely distributed . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to see it in the near future . this description is therefore currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point , which has a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically in DSL links , so it will not be surprised if in the event of active DSL links another content can be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted in creating a surface for tar , which also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a band can be used , it has to be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ trains the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; if you do not notice the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ st@@ ressing , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smooth , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched for the band through un@@ folding the entry .
before ej@@ ection of the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; returns with a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be thrown out without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires that a tape has to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the band of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually do not require format@@ ting of the tape , but DAT drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape continues . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
mark a f@@ use profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
mark files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so @-@ selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select in the Save Menu ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up Settings for Backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
ri@@ ght@@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog , you can review your selection once again and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initiate the restore , the files to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub @-@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
ri@@ ght@@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can review your selection once again and change the work folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file on the basis of the belt content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a f@@ use profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up in the same file system as the folder . folders on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to as@@ certain the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before the inv@@ ocation of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons is &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings on the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape machine .
if this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mes@@ hes load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection from the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the tape is automatically dis@@ connected . don &apos;t use this option for flo@@ ppy streams .
if the option is turned on , attempts &amp; k@@ dat to change the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( N Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the volume was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the volume was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is integrated .
&amp; k@@ systemic log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . furthermore , experienced users provide quick access to information about problems appearing on their server .
&amp; k@@ systemic log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ systemic log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
it also enables experienced users to quickly access information on issues that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ systemic log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 owns &amp; k@@ systemic log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot : functions available to easily filter and sort the protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log , first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens instead of a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ systemic log ; very likely not having system administrator rights . the protocol files usually do not have authorization to read in the folder / var / log , for the normal user .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criteri@@ on or after input strings . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so that only log lines appear next to the filter . in the default setting , the selection field contains the entry All . then , a protocol row is displayed only if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column . for example , in the Protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ strip ; all protocol @-@ lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows . protocol rows of step errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as a protocol @-@ line of the stage hint . the colored display of protocol rows can be shut down in the direction dialog .
if you want to display only a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this may be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip .
in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to display all new Add @-@ In @-@ lines .
&amp; k@@ systemic log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ systemic log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ systemic log ; .
&amp; k@@ systemic log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ native log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system quickly develops into the standard for program start @-@ up when starting the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to system V in@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format@@ ting . Linux ; kernel first looks under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sys@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc directly in / etc . this folder is named r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you run the system or switch to another run@@ level .
r@@ c.@@ local should in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab manually and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you come to fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that in this folder there are no proper files . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called up with the argument . if it contains an S , the script is called with the argument start .
some people want to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc ; start .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six run@@ ways to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level while pulling it somewhere else . this is done only if it removes an entry from the field of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you move them into a new section . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown in the Recy@@ cle B@@ in . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to hit a selection above or below previous .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it by cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc ) if available . otherwise , they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc file .
I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine is starting to re@@ boot . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry saving in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two maps , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the user or group properties dialog .
some map maps are displayed only if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional flash@@ cards appear , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card file password management appears , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd , as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this map will only appear if a limited file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable at the quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space limitations specified in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field limitation with the field file system .
the board map groups inform@@ s about the group affili@@ ates of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu , or click the Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group functions analog .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
