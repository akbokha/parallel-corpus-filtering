<seg id="1">To translate the module website in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Webpage. select from the drop-down list the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part is translated into place of the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions without checking the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web sites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translation texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in features can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, select Settings extensions.... open the card-card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard insertion modules from the box kde; addons. please note that maybe more modules are available on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package containing & konqueror, before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & konqueror; click Extras Departure. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; for crash, or the list of crashes, if any, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle filter (also called Folder Filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar below Extras address filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root burr of the document, Example: documentric, all other knots are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists in representing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size of a file or folder is mirrored, while the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily identified if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap presentation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is sufficient space to display, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (where, consequently, representation errors can occur with the mark of the path). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps performance algorithms, the rule should be observed, that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always adhered. it will be drawn frame to indicate the nesting of entries, and that frame will need space that will then no longer be available to the subordinate entries.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is always preferable for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frameworks so that rectangles arise that are as square as possible. the best methods of this are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry view at area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the application of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the Picture Gallery in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Gallery... or Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery, a dialog opens, which allows you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The page title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line option has a slide bar and a turntable to set the number of images of each line in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="33">Copy the original pictures with the box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the box comment file, you can specify a comment file for capturing the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the box sele color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail pictures than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the navigator can be set here:</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digiplug; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digiplug; includes fast image processing with basic image processing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Plugins (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam it is easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digiplug; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digiplug; attempts to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or wishes. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error report system. all information you need is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digiplug; is a project supported by a community. that is, if you are a regular user of & digiplug; if you are a regular user of & digiplug; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users. however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; visit home page to get news about released versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digies; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digiplug; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can enter a local, remote, or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digiplug; will also use as an Albenbibliothek. digiKam settings set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder, the images, as a base folder. & digikam; view every subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digiplug; thirdly recursively the library path in its full depth. you can't exclude sub-folders unless it's the case in hidden folders. you can do this by placing one point in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you've configured the base folder, you can get in & digiplug; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw File Support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can & digiplug; possibly handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the help of raw camera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decoderners and Roh Workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digiplug; you can download more than 1000 digital cameras using the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras excel through the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transfer to the calculator, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digiplug; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital camera camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras supporting a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions over serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that digiKam preview images can be read reliably. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digicame; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI Module: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (Manual) is one approach to develop a common module structure for & digiplug; to provide KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate pictures in virtually any way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier to add & digiplug; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digicame; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page strings with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and laying pictures works everywhere: you can store a picture in another part of the alabyte, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that you can't place an image in keywords, data comparison list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the toolbar. so filtering on the filename will only work if this is shown in the toolbar. which fields can be displayed in the Albends dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by folders where they were stored on the hard disk, sorted by the name of their collection in the albenproperties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album imports images. you can also add a screenshot to an album. select Album imports screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from an album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the menu then you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to gather information about this collection. to access the album properties, you have to click on the album with the right mouse button and edit the album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you choose is used to sort your photos after collection from the toolbar or view albums after collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons mature, average, nests: these set the date to the date of the oldest, the latest image or that of the average of the album. to do this, first attempt to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digiplug; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; selected. this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and click on the context menu & quot; As album preview, select. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digiplug; support the entry of keyword for individual photos in the area My keyword list left down in the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images are displayed in this album in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid using all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the associated preview. which information this is, you can edit digiplug settings; change it. select the Albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you have a moment to rest over a picture, the help shows the most important features including all the key features of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that happened at & digicame; works. albums and Tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these. you can select all the features with & digiplug. you can choose between the viewing of images, a slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing by using either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... selecting. in the digiplug section; image editing, you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. the applications listed there are controlled by the & kde; file assignments for the file type.</seg>
<seg id="103">Some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digiplug; provides two ways to rotate. the easiest is to click on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, you can right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo from & digiplug; delete, it will be moved to the garbage bin of & kde; moved. F8 image deletion or delete if you'd rather want to delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Datumslider quot; organizes your photos according to the data. & digiplug; uses either the EXIF date or if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. Tags are stickers, the individual photos or entire groups can be assigned. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also work parts of the tree & quot; My keywords lipiquot; fold up so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The key words are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the image's IPTC data fields, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the key words are re-imported in the loss of the database as soon as the digicomes; the pictures are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by using the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword, or click on an existing keyword and then choose New Keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will become the subtitle of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and laying there. then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword, drag and drop it. alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can use a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and remove from the Tags-menu. the menu shows only the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. thus, all associated images are displayed in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the box below you can type a title and save your selection. it then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Encompass all items of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">When you click here, the filter will be deleted and all the pictures are displayed again. if the search hasn't found anything, then the lamp is red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with the binoculars. if you open this you will see a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here as a live search that filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you're satisfied with your selection, hit the head OK and the search is done. the results are displayed in the View My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search, you just need to select the appropriate entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Search, the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information. if you select As extended search, the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced Search section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select in the context menu search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digies; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the database database. all rules are added line-wise, separated by operators. an option can be added with others via the logical operations All..., One..., None... or At least.... in addition, you can create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digiplug; characterizes any image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one. using a treshold, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you move an image from somewhere over the icon of the tongue search in the left side bar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand paint sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digiplug; find matching images. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive navigation tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can press the mouse wheel in or out zoom or hold it and move it. move it while you pull the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the box below you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digiplug; provides a light table in a separate window allowing you to easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the light table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened. if you are back in the window, you can open the illuminated table quickly with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview strip you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select Preview synchronize from the toolbar and perform Zoo and deportation operations on one of the images, you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly retrieve from a series of images. if you use pairs from the toolbar, the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. now, use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal fire transactions work directly from the light table, such as F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the main window's right side bar is available in the illuminated table for both thumbnails. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area, you will find a built-in pivot function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to swing the visible area of the image, you need to click on them and hold the & LMB; in preview, both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Just use the zoom-knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in preview.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital asset management - away from the fashion word? digital asset management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken right up to the final output and the permanent storage. each of the photos takes, scans or digital photos saves a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use your pictures. in doing so, we concentrate on the process for digital photographers that & digiplug; we look at downloading, renaming, removing, converting, archiving, optimising, waiting and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is data stored in accordance with your definition, providing information on or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't need to find a certain photo without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use & digiplug;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you care for anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can quickly be found in the same place. if you make enough photos, you will be able to use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant feeding of images to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes stacking handling easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option stored in & digiplug's settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget it, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? to do so & digiplug; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, labels and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value then. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos for further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you often call other programs, or Categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or insert images in the right place. changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drawing a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is a very rough representation, since each bloc contains metadata in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anybody see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from a distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing field of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so, the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help Him through the subject that has moved you to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. KDE also provides you with a spell checker. if you export your images to web galleries, then these labels will not tell you a second time after your wishes into the labeling and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system? wasn't it Earth a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now driving with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travel using pictures with geographic data. & digiplug; can also export kml files you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the furnishing page of & digikam, as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may not be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples may be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note on the author's field, this must also be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the image is a store photo, then here is the group / agency that offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they have no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this metadata in the image. for private individuals this is very important for most of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiplug; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, disk failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, asterrage, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or negatives. in this section, it is about problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll ontrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated careful and you can no longer trust you as a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be readable, but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good discs and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they altern through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a cheaper program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Don't forget to copy the media with a description, date & author, and then on a clean, dark dry and sheltered location. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Diskmanagers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's products include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: floppy disk devices</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common cause of error, SMART, is the most common cause of error. SMART's errors are the most common cause of error. some of SMART detect the imminent failure. these are in particular read errors and publishing counter. the expected duration of life is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before securing the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances do not make much noise, this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause severe damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause serious damage, complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed motherboards and other defects.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against spikes is a surge protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy slots and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug connector. remember, however, that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also make sure that it provides protection against lightening and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since the overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors that also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the television map.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable surge protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models even allow them to continue working until the current is running. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security in case of electricity disturbances with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to 30 euro; 20 costs, one 500W USV you can get for less than & euro; 40. finally, you should remember how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, compared to the hard drives at home, however, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. furthermore, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very safe. data transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are prone to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these disorders remain undetected until you have one day to open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they create interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors on a low level and highly scalable. it's open source, with many patents and is available in a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an own initiative with its btrf filesystem. this is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebooks and 46% on workstation systems. in notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to minor damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most popular filesystems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation process with a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras include 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result, the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anybody else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. so, backup your data after a plan and test this backup before you do anything dangerous like the re-installation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">Disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget plane accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, asteroids always means not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential Security: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential security.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental FUSE: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of the files that have really been changed. this is done compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have them stored on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of your working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly schedule for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata that stored IPTC data stored in the image file, retained XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, vision devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider everything that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered on the basis of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the print expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means more and more.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set up the scalability and want to expand the area you want to expand to a dedicated plate or partition. for * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command to see if your new disk was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc (source is / dev / sdc / dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBgt; # works with ext3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sdc1 # change the size of the extension if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be simpler from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG can be used as an open source standard of GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and have a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (default). it manages pictures in high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Digital Negative File Format is a licence-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is designed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why to replace Adobe's XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive. XMP fits as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, the raw format is old. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as containers and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera service are, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for fine-layer processing. if you edit the pictures again with & digiplug; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were, under certain circumstances, cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; in the addition of a photo to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your album database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it attempts to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a ferous indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will be displayed. some cameras do not display any preview images. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol are shown for your file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the aspect properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer's note, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of & digiplug; or image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digiplug;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, you can download the download and then select Selected. the Selected button will be displayed as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images were not yet downloaded by & digiplug. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download all of the buttons you download or download selected, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of the existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you've selected the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, you must first select it and then delete the selected deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no photos that you deleted from the camera. the photos are not deleted in the garbage bin of & kde; you should carefully check if the photos have been downloaded successfully into a digiplug; -Album if you want to completely erase them from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera memory, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are usually used again after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames, if you upload photos of different recording series to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created once a day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three other options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two are related to the data on the author in the Standard Car Identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photoso-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the filenames in lowercase when you download. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digiplug; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording, to perform an automatic rotation during shutter. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is normally switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, lets & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made, and digiplug, use this to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subdirectory. not all cameras provide this information. in the page bar Meta data, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case, & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the option date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digiplug; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in Longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. identifying the data can be carried out by the American GPS, Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser with a click that shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to draw the positional data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, about reworking the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and last via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsdt or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format because this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are several programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the length and width degrees or other data, then you can use this script that works with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the characters of hairy coordinates created, for example, maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digiplug; attempts to give you so much control over its workflow as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digicame; change. to access these settings, you need to set up in the Settings menu; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set on Embedded Preview or Restore image processing. you set the standard behavior of & digikam; fix when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for writers: this field should contain the professional name of the photographer. this may be labels such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify what the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if this is for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here because this is the image of others & quot; then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC fields. this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the digiplug database; these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digiplug; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image captions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images save: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the images. this allows you to read your captions from other screen viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options that appear when the mouse cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digies; attempt to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in any & digiplug; file folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored by & digiplug; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the Light of & digiplug; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the illuminated table, these settings are not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter color in the picture. these colors are set here. in image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF command option compression, you can turn the default compression algorithm for TIFF photos. this reduces the size of the TIFF photos. it has no influence on image quality because the Deflate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setup, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. at the moment, it is quickly becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image processing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default behavior is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight pixel of the CCD sensor is more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is a solid color balance based on a white card photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images will get more details in four steps in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned into, due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights, as a continuous white look. the setting colors trigger some unusual results, since they display the top lights in various shades of pink. last, you can try some parts of the missing information from the shrouds to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as quickly as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions out of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstructions, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this may later be done in the picture options of the & digiplug; image processing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that come from the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color-design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digiplug; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity-directional) was the quality for me and the paper used by me.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction since it is done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions as it should be given again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information on how to translate colour information from a color space in the other so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Create the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC-Profiles you have here the possibility & quot; default source; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when the raw file is opened later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are colored not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color tone mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to carry out the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof Profile, which allows you to emulate just how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image, as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors may therefore work very saturated. this could manually correct you instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's pretty obvious which color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. naturally, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin Interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewing and image processing. by providing this interface, & digiplug; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will then be downloaded by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings brief commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the picture transitions, normally 4-5 seconds good. the other check boxes switch the metadata, respectively, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right side there is a button Automatic recognition that tries to identify a camera attached to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the screen mode. currently, serial ports, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only activated if you have a USB or FireWire mass storage camera selected from the camera list. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / digits, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check whether & digies; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be shown in the main window's cameras. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images to the dustbin, you can display the digitization of & digiplug; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details in deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly charged by & digikam; apply if you use the option Changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the & digiplug welcome screen; this speeds up the start-up of & digiplug;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting At Start for new photos is forcing & digiplug to look for new or deleted albums / photos. this prolongs the start time of & digiplug; if something was deleted from the base folder, the digicame; you, if it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digies; used to customize the main window to your taste. you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug; create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digiplug; includes quick image processing with some base tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; they may not be part of your distribution. you may also find more information on the KIPI modules in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, displaying file name, current file number, magnification factor, and current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most commonly required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved the file Save or the button Save from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore File menu or the button Unrestore the image processing in the toolbar. you will lose any change you've done on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of image processing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting undo / resetting Edit from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; over the back or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture or the entries in the File menu. if you made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; Mouse Wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc button. if you do not want this, you can change this in the Settings dialog by & digiplug. you can view it from the & digiplug; main window. see the section for setting image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or entire phrases. whole image templates can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export job supervisor. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is, without the navigation arrows, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the page bar to appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated to 2000 characters and special characters are reversed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you've chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The appraisal section evaluates a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gradings. it can either be applied with a single mouse click on the 5 stars to the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a drop-down box with previously used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when typing keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate crossfields in the tree. all key words of an image are keyword stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keybar stub terminator is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar with their album, - date, keyword and search views is used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and disclose keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keyword. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears, which asks you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched from settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and the rule area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an extended search over all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors you have from your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make sure that links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflows meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you use another color space and then think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to make my monitor calligraphic if I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in sRGB color space or not, you need to calligraphic your monitor since sRGB works on sRGB so you need to calligraphic your monitor on sRGB-Standard, use a matching monitor profile, or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalizing, balancing, automatic balance and contrast extend from the menu Correcise Automatic correction attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the comparisons have very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic compensation: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Extending contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a re-jibtion of all values in between. this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Balance of & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you can be too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, then your possibilities for correction will be better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, click the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the eluminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram appears that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit photos, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above-mentioned controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance to the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colours when more than one pixel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons saving and loading make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings button clears all filter values back to their default values and the neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guide to use color profiles lets you consult the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so you can also use your settings so you always need the same correction. in the manual for correct toning correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solarisation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called the Sabatier, was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure from the extra light. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photographic paper from the extra light. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar isation. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the intensity applied is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of the photo. you can experiment to experiment the various color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the Tool Toncker Correction is used to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here. more specifically the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph three sliders are clicked inside and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control knob and make sure that the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box, it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, linear visualization is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pintes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used for creating an easy image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later. in addition, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on preview of the original image to set the histogram for red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and no effect can be seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifide channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is usually the most useful. for images with large areas of constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve edge to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones corresponded with darker output tones and that the image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to shift this marker to the area you want to change, a fitting line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if overexposed pixels are found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun tones were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The digipsed channel mixer; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or to change the color shade of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram. this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram appears to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the picture will also retain the general brightness as the channel mixer is then the tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. colourfull consists of small spatial artifacts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you first reduce the colour space.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save and load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview, and no effect can be seen in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction ability. with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step as color images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky. similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and enhances the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithelium: produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of leaching a pressure and redevelopment in a sepia pad. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) epiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digiplug; apply mold texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the impression of the depth or the three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; Add a tool box can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you insert the desired frame type for your image. passing through the picture with a coloured line, Niepce stranded with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), it borders with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a pop-up effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple formatted text into an image at any location. this also works in several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text output, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. the bigger the picture, the bigger the character set needs to be.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & digiplug; apply mold Template you can place a template using a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template can be used in image processing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the digiplug, please send an email to the & digiplug; Mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you are using this tool for the first time, you must set your stencil folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view mirrors which reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the thumbnail of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">In the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button decreases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychodynamic. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images require correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process paints colors with only minimal differences to a collage. the same phenomenon can be observed when color pixels are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more detrimental sharpness than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">A camera internal sharpness has often been applied to JPEG pictures. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners have a field filter already during reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the Sharpening Tool. you can get sharpening using the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should use it carefully as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can refocus it through the menu entry Corrigation. under refocusing you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is much simpler than it is to sharpen. use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry Corrigate softens and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp maskieren is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or amount reinforce the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of atrocities will produce near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpens pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount sets the percentage between the original and the wiped image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. thus, you can define a minimum difference with it for a edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are removed from sharpen and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blurred mask. refocus usually achieves better results than blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fission has a very long tail, which results in a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixels that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß 'folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focus: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should yield 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is blurred then pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0, the picture quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß 'sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß' sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness is gauss. in most cases you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a non-zero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular edge or the gauge. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not visible immediately, but later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, inaccurate masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp mask using a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharpness. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear filter. practically the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the Auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the sharpness of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows a customized colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Injection Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CIMg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail preservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth surfaces and let details sharp. a value of 0.9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise will generate a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above every. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is available, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed through. usually, here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle steps [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal. however, it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how screen errors can be removed with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a peculiar black artefact caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool selects selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value places the pixel spacing at the front looking to see light density changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and hiss or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not all noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG-artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the settings controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the settings controlled by the details.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the tolerances of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically more strongly rushed.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of phase jittering attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear flatter when it is too high, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges. it can remove hiss and is the recommended method for this.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for soft signs with the menu entry Corrigate softens and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or retrospectively digitized images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thus preserves the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CIMg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression from JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it creates some compression & quot; Artefaktease; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons saving and loading make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were created with a scanner and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows the Hotpixel of photos to be removed using a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photographs as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. they are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image section and the preview help you correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. after that, select the best filter method to interpolate these pixelblocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a spacing of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic interface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digiplug; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shading) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reaching the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera manually. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise impenity effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure range of today's film and color shades of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by law by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further adjustment of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2,. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction lowers the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer adjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation of the & digiplug; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. coloured distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth degree corrects the removed corners countered to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, each geometric distortion can be eliminated virtually.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tons of distortion can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree. this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameter' has the reverse sign of the parameter in general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value will scale the image size and result in a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion corrections. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tanning or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best do this correction than all first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would appear apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the Tonn- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transform cutting from image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs, such as shots from the front, frame and picture, is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera manually you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared video of the Gimpanzu.org web page that is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IIR film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film grain and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Add filming, if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO figures generate a kind of aura in the peak lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug filter is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film material on your pictures. this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver granules of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, granular sight particularly in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to the control of the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that processed the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controllers to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. flatten the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the hindiness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is labeled with (1) and the editor is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; Filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients slowly change are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen for you to sketch.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller chooses the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; filter engraver shapes your picture in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; filter engraver is a fast tool to return your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important aspect of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: divides the image into cells and makes it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analog to the wavelengths 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom lens: blurs the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement blur: wipes the image through horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear motion, z: B: a car or a train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurs the image softly in the dark tones and strongly in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Defensive sharpness: wipes the image through random shift of pixels and simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel count.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your images a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows changing the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digiplug; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. to do so, use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that is free to stay. if you want to start the filter of raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right orientation due to mirroring or turning. you will find the tools in the menu Transformers rotating or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CIMg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose transformersize change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to counter the pixel. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge image. & digiplug; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CIMg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain the aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the original image aspect ratio is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is available, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons saving and loading are used precisely for this. every single stuttering for photo can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can last very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo blowing by magnifying a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently-run operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a picture you just need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and drawing up the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo is cut off. this gives you a good overview like your photo after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the Cut-Cut button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save File in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog is retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right side of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the dialog box, you can set the area for cutting to the widest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Following page ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the editing tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the cohesive help enable you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious Triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a way to divide rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that relies on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where each number is equal to the sum of their two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid guides when you put together a picture. these aids are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos to your goal. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition performs the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to guide the golden spiral. it should be something that directs the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the above-mentioned golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not a triangular triangles. to place diagonal on these lines a static object can be released more dynamically.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirroring and mirrored can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the color button you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digiplug; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button Preferences, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is to use the function transformation cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. note, however, the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be recalculated automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformation cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The locking tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the picture becomes a bit blurred. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two doses bearing twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After graduation, the picture has unattractive triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformation from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; needs a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug; edit.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digiplug; shows only files in formats that know. this happens by means of the file extension and a comparison of them with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digiplug; the file in the image processing will be displayed. you can change this list of file extensions. in the configuration section, you can find more information on this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF to the raw image converter from & digiplug; in the configuration section you will find further information on how to use & digiplug modules.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digiplug; supports loading of shell images only with the program dcraw, which is included in & digiplug. with this you can see more than 200 raw file formats. all support cameras you can see below on the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from & digiplug; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. these clips are often stored in the AVI- or MPEG format. & digiplug; understands these formats and will therefore not display films or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digiplug; use & kde; settings to play movies use to start the program for playback.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to edit the photo are in & digiplug; contain. your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpness, molluscs, noise reduction, refocus, unsharp maskieren, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you can see & quot; Texture applied; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image. links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical divide without duplicate. the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal divides without duplicate. the upper section displays the original and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">The upper section shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'mouse over 'style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview. preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings of the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data come from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive navigation tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can press the mouse wheel in or out zoom or hold it and move it. move it while you pull the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for pallet files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and select and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The Paletten-Files, which are installed by & kde, can apply either for the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; -settings and hot user-defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog box, you can select from a list of installed pallet or search the folder after files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is displayed as a line in the palette view. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the color next to it. the color is described below the palette view. here, the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the Anm Cursor check box is activated under the color button, the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwritten another; depending on whether the mode of overwriting has been selected.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that was created as described in the last section can be used along with the actions copying, cutting, and pasting.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the portions of red, green and blue and an optional colour name followed by a line-ending character if a further color follows. if there are three numbers values in the clipboard, these can be added as a color in & kcoloredit;</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the color selection can be drawn with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="724">Select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left.</seg>
<seg id="725">& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program used to view & graph; -dot; -graphs; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphic viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphic viewer; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphic viewer; shows graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; recounts the graph and is represented in & kimaviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; to open or to open the graphs in & kgraphic viewer; in a & kate; -component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 vertices and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kgraphic viewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for representing the graphs required. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the open graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kimaviewer; without any argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom of the screen. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & alto; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently in & koloviewer; loaded file was modified by another program, the following window is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphic viewer; can also remember your decision, so that later will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kimaviewer; see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a running & kgraphic viewer; open instance, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kimaviewer; instance, or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">During the program start, you can open all graphs of your last session. once again, you can save your choice as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph shall be divided on several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page are to be incorporated into this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a page distributed on several pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut shop page gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard disk, eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or leave the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kimaviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of & kimaviewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at any start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which is usually in a click in the main window with the & RMBn; appears, opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; -layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the page of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered displays of directional graphs. the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato algorithm is the standard for uncoated graphs. it produces representations according to the spring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm generates a spring model layout for ungerified graphs. it uses the Fruitiman-Reingold heuristic, and includes a multiple grid for treating large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm adjusts the nodes circular to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should print the graphite file as a parameter, and print the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can & eg; modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphs (directed or ungeried) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for uncoated graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows the What is the -mouse pointer. with this pointer, click on a & GUI; element to get more help to this item (if any).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module can read images and provide tools to read and save new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports by the sane project or another source such as video streams. so that this works you have to have Kooka and sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry pictures, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default ducal default values to select your image. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image using the button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the scan button, you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file's options. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by storing the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshot once you have selected in the Importieren- &gt; Screen-Picture... menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen pictures:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the entire desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other work surfaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send his photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, place the photos of your camera phone online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module exporting to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a flickr server on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">When you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentification. it is thus virtually your reference to Flickr. a browser is started so you can log in with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will see the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr is started twice, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module displays. at the moment, you need write permissions. the module currently does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The key word field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillie you can set the permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before the upload, the photos will be changed in front of the upload in size. the size is taken out of the value registered for maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module Galerie-Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Galerie-Export has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Correlation. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want correlate in the main window and call up the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file naturally contains data that were recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded at GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time deviation indicates a top deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation under it, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds then will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can put these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the shown map. select the region and enlarge sie.Charge this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a Picture Gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you don't need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the sample preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you then click on a picture, a new page is opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be stored with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport, containing everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images is also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth, which naturally affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab shows you some of the settings from the album tab for the thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if error occurred during generation. the web browser is automatically started in the end to preview the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or sliding. the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons. it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed as standard in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the lossless storage is that the file size increases as there is no compression of color information. this can be found in PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI Module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The mpeg encoder module can be used to convert selected images to an MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can start the module using Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to reproduce the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high on the other hand very smooth picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep in mind as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start generating the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer, you can quickly or in all tranquillity go a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that code or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together into standard photo prints. the combined images can also be automatically opened using the image processing gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and run the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for the white balance. the main parameters like gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your images often or later on, you should not select the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion button with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it to cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to rewrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have launched the module, the images window will be displayed with the pictures you selected. you can add more images using the button images. for the last selected image, a preview on the right side is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place them there to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images you will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you select are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't pay too many pictures at once. most email accounts have restrictions for the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. their configuration is stored and re-used every time you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and attached to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format in the picture file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted among lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in images file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original Exam data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is done, the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages, searching for errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. you can close this window with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Dichroau a window with questions how to display your slideshow appears. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL option in the presentation option enables very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually break it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between the images chooses another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the entire number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; through these browsers, see image. as you can see through a comparison with the image, now in any group, i.e. in people, places and in the group keywords entries are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images shown on which both people are visible are displayed. this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can view with preview images to view the pictures of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which of course applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined for yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the names, select the button on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you will need to specify which image is to be displayed for each individual. to do this, you need to open the Picture Anchor window (in detail) and display in the context menu the entry categories editor. in the Check window, you can adjust the magnification factor to your wishes, selecting which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can look at this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date may be either a part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use an area of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can search all images by specific names as you can see in the picture. here, pictures where Jesper but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & Photo album; and in the first dialog choose the demo if you start & go photoalbum; for the first time, or select from the menu Help the menu entry kphotoalbum; -Demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you would like to print this manual, you can find it on the website of & kphotoalbum; as a cohesive HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name says, this bar displays date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries thumbnail view from the database (when you select a date, the first image of this date will appear in the preview array) and also the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of timeline, holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select a area, you will only view images of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; built-in version that you can create through the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created on the overview page. more information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. therefore, you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download any more images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to see an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all your HTML files, select a root folder and select a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder you need to manually copy them there. for the import function, see, properly functioning you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs. in these, a sub-folder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are coming together on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent much time applying the image information to persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & photoalbum; this work does not even do once.</seg>
<seg id="932">With PhotoAlbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file, which can import others to your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim -files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file, or whether there is only a link to images in the file. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you can share all the pictures and pass this file independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file scans the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files will be browsed. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file by using the HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can call through the File Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is about internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you copy manually to the .kim file, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically close the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is normally not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file import... select & kphotoalbum; the exported base will import as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Wizard to Import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named with your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and what categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will pass the various steps of (1) set up the information about your images, about (2) the browsing and prestige, right up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures, but it was expanded and today your videos are also taking care of. in many places in this manual you talk about images, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the topmost folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoalbum; remembers the folder in which your pictures are stored and used it automatically in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & Photo album; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Go to a window with which you can modify the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the User Manual, the different settings will be explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you can see six different icons with which you can view settings of preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can specify different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a labeling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog Options, you can set up complete member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group enlist rather than all groups of a member as explained in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its module system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be invoked via the Module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page, which you can access via the module yourself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by several applications each other, it may be that the modules are tested with & photoalbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules work with & photoalbum; not function. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order after albums for some modules to enable you to use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulating & photoalbum; the current album that simply matches the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album & photoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here & Photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category persons, for example, will & photoalbum; so do so, whether you would have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are not compatible with PhotoAlbum, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the module you want to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to by any other KDE application, you can see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you can see the window with which you can browse your picture database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry pictures to show you an overview of all available pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of PhotoAlbum is the ability to annotate any image with annotations. this includes information about the persons in the picture where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. for example, on all pictures Jesper is shown and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of PhotoAlbum; since you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to suspend images within the list: if you have for example a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are mapped, you can, so that the names used up are moved up, find the persons faster and assign them.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting icon by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and comment on these images. in this case, simply click on the button before and back buttons, which are on the top of the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at a time with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that shows the US as an overboard. to show you that it is an overboard, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the annotation, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to order to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and panning the bars that form the top of the frame. you can also create a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options... that offers you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also omit a frame completely. if you want to see this window later, use the button Options... and then hide / hide the window. this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">When you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images in case you have no filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, to configure. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be shown in the image viewer. if you do not yet open a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press the Remove button or select Edit selection in the Edit menu. now, the window will display that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; you can also use the pictures without storing it on your hard disk. of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all the required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is truncated, are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the images 5-9, the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the preview of these images. however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy and re-paste files from the folders. & kphotoalbum; do not support you until now you don't need to ask for the insertion of the CD. so, if you want to avoid annoying your pictures, please buy a larger hard disk to save all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the View menu you will find a sub-menu with the name Privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those you want to make inaccessible for others and click on Current View locking in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister may see, control and lock the menu entry Everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set up which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop now your little sister, simply select the menu entry pictures, which will hide all the images you have locked. if you want to see the pictures again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select a password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on one hand, all images can be accessed on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the index.xml file can read out or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & photoalbum; not very familiar to obstruct the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & photoalbum; it has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can easily pull it with the mouse and discard it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see matching entries to this page. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all images by Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from your browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and picture. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be checked by pressing the Ctrl + Plus or minus keys.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out. for the zoom-zoom, you can simply pull a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom out the Plus button zooming in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom so that the image is not shown zoomed. with the right button, the zooms set the zoom, so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are that in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this doesn't work for videos. you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can cancel the picture and open configuration dialog of the image to enter that name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you view one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this you can see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available to you in the browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have chosen, just add all of your notes. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and especially features can be displayed in preview screen. if you can view categories in the preview screen, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the character for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it's not clear what you want to show on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In, you can see a picture on which was painted. to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the picture from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; to work, you need to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire-mode views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subobject of an already selected object, as all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar, or select a menu entry in the menu Insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop down menu will appear, so that you can select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the Edit menu bar, or right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take over those changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and then re-click on users or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera control points. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross will appear in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifting. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level of the scene in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it in any way. you can also store multiple windows and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over one another, pull the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map of the map on the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views which are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from anchoring, pull the starter on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the starter bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the groin strip. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view allows you to save window ordering... save. it displays a dialog in which you can store the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, was & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon The icon Rendering in the toolbar, or select the menu entry view.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode meets the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">When you hit the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render Modi menu, select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can type any name, but it makes sense to be a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the cross section and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Quality of Combination, you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam each pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel in the display. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. in general, pictures with this feature are better off.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the adjacent pixels with inclusion. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is continuously divided further and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">When you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion allows you to adjust the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called jittering. when you turn on jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import an & Povray scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not the full command set of & Povray;. when error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this code between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code to the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can also insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation on the displayed object. place the path to your document and the version here. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height area data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window-type license plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling, and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects like the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail truths for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is shown in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a bottom is ridden beneath the objects. the bottom is shown in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold. in the section Render-Modi, you can find more information about the parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing windows or create new window-orders. in the window ordering section, it explains how to create and store windows.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement module: displays all existing window systems. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The existing window rankings display all existing window rankings. a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement using the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window ordering. new views can be created by button Add and Delete selected views with the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten, Fix a map view along with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have straight & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without any more detailed knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, very popular among beginners: a sphere on a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully note the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything faultlessly, see & kpovmodeler for the first start; the following pre-set window ordering:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the User Documentation of & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera has control points in the view, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the user button or the Enter button, the wirebox views and the object tree instantly change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert the final body square) and set the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to resolve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite layer as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or Enter. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wirebox view also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite level. when you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the bottom to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first sub-object. the pigment will then change in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matt black material because you need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview. also, there are many possibilities again, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the headers and bullet in the preview, just click the Apply button and then get the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Solid Color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, each time you choose one-colored and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done simply because you should have understood the basic work method of & kpovmodeler; you should have already understood it. the ball can be created just as simple as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (don't forget to press the input key or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering is now a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the bullet, you can now assign a material to it. as with the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on Ball Pigment, then choose Monochrome and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness-effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should have a good impression of what options are available to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully, you have learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a render method to produce a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you play a scene, the renderer will shoot hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last commands to be reversed. you can only select this menu entry if you have used Edit Compatibility.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window ordering and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or rewrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump-map is a way to preclude rough surfaces without needing to model any diffraction on the surface without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a dump-map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes which you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base using an image file as color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode.</seg>

Choose.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as "Amarok;" short commands. this makes your keyboard simpler and Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, most of which can also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all needed modules are present and use kdialog so that the user knows why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates directory you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly notice that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages make it possible to run external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is mostly used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; send alerts to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the default scripts of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond appropriately to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Dests the script to display the setup dialog. in order to store and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is played. the script could now use DCOP functions to retrieve further information about the new piece (e.g. metadata or piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume indicates a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizclicked: submenu itematic paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itematic are also passed, so that the script can use the menu item dcop Amarok script addressTools Item (submenu itematic).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarok script administration can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name like e.g. mysql.t.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the initialization amarocscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packets right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can add it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script side of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok, you can simply drag music to the playlist rather than getting through endless menus. maybe you just search for a specific title for thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which ones you want to listen to? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake, you should have no difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options to enable or disable the compile-time point with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used. for details, see the System Requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you would like to help with the development of & Amarok, you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without any trouble over the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the various functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition to the playlist, the player window will switch to the playlist. if the option is off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you activate this setting, & Amarok will use relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Make updates visible when changing the piece, so that the playlist window will roll up / down to keep the current piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing items to context browsers automatically switch to the context browser as soon as the next piece is picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can adjust the Appearance & Amarok's Appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting custom fonts, the otherwise grey displayed section will be activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player window and context browser. press select... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme. to do this, use the color selection for front and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Replay at the start means that & Amarok; after the start of the program, the playback will continue with the piece at the spot, with which it has been stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be portrayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the OSD colors for writing and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if own colors are not activated, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The input field Display text displays the text displayed in the OSD. by typing placeholders, the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is designed for Xinerama users, allowing you to specify which screen in a multi-monitor environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field. some drivers still activate more settings in this map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The Collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that is to be searched for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the selected and their sub-folders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders for changes (e.g. when added or deleted music files). in addition, incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pl.and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added renchlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql Device section is used to set the database for & Amarok; under calculator: enter the computer on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered under which the database is reachable. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card card provides support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Call for similar interpreters: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list of similar performers to the played piece. note: you can view the list in the context browser. note: you do not need a last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD assume that your window manager will keep the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib-Developer under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and let the collection go again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, this is because taglib is crashing when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this error to the TagLib-Developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all libraries of & Amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crash when processing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use kDE with artsd, then disable automatic turning off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically on a crash). if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many program files write data as UTF-8 into meta-Infos, but do not mark it as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very easy. drag entries from the collection browser into the playlist. the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces. if you are happy with the playlist, you can save it with the help of the button playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add them to the playlist browser. if the playlist is included in your collection, and you have enabled the option to import playlists, then these playlists are already in the tree view. with a right click on a playlist, you will find different ways to load the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, please select audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD tracks in WAV format. drag the wav files into the playlist and then press the Playback button.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packets are listed below. in addition, some additional packages are listed that make work with Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important features.</seg>
<seg id="1334">In this chapter, it explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one click & Amarok; Control Centre. at the top of the window is a running textual display that displays the current piece or the current stream. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch through the available analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlarged window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the gait display, the PL and EQ buttons are also located. the PL knob is activated or deactivates the playlist window while the button EQ is used to set equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the slider to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous track.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to Techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the Main Menu or click the button EQ in the player window. once you activate the checkbox Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist for all & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that there is no other player. but don't let the plethora of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area you can find some of the excellent playlist features, such as the context browser. on the right, you find the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet powerful enough even for advanced users.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser shows different information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and artist. these three subwindows will be explained later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have earlier used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the start window is off. the information presented there are now available in other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information in the Statistic window can be viewed (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, performer and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to emulate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You'll find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you'll see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer. this section displays the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set what information should be displayed in the music subwindow. right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the single areas to begin playback immediately. you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. once you click the text subwindow, try and download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the edited version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button searches a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top layer, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First, the pieces are arranged according to the artist and below is another division after the respective album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname will be related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are alphabetically sorted among each other. the artist is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - Your songs are first sorted by genre and, among them, artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folder. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly below the toolbar there is a search filter. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section of the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection field, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and adds the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will then be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the media player queue for a long time. for more details, see the Media Player Browser section.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - Daddy will send the selected pieces to K3b and either burned as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files in the trash... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">As a compilation, select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Highlight compilation - Changes as a compilation of selected albums back into a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be shown under various interpreters, but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart Playlist. there, you can enter all the required criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, it must be embedded in / mnt / ipod. when & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod after interpreter in the top list view of the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list interpreter. if you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, stop & Amarok; and loosen the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area that allows you to search for a file. the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files, because all files are hidden in the file list, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you type tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than is in the window, the attachments of files can be difficult by simply falling down. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be useful: thus, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces that you want to play. you can change the order by simply inserting the entries with the mouse to the desired place. as soon as you enter letters there, only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search words separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms, search for entries that either contain one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain whitespace, then close the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries like Mike Oldfield, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: appraisal: &gt; 50. this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign before the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this looks for all pieces containing either Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key, and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries. the entries then receive a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you can find the Add button with which you can add the playlist pieces. to the right, you will find the playlist, empty playlist, and Random Mic.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons next follow and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as you see in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; s configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many other buttons available for the toolbar, for example, play control and volume control. you can set up the buttons that are displayed by clicking on the menu and clicking on toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The Status Bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by double clicking with the mouse into the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the Status Bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist on the menu.</seg>

<seg id="1409">The queue administration got your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece into the queue, the playlist will display a number next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">When you want to add a piece of the queue, select the piece in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>

<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog prompts you to a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then instantly be burned by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported yet, you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog prompts you to a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, coding settings and even options to modify the size and cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b;. when an entry is crossed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is crossed, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not enabled, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view will display an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, its content will appear in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info, locking and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and dragging files to the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD folder in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrower section, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header does not have any real function, it looks only pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to modify the key assignments for & k3b;. after selecting one of the commands available in the upper section, you can adjust the mapping process to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b;. here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should function at startup. this dialog is intended for personalising and fine-tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the DCOP functions, you can use either the dcop command line program, or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the range of functions, so your taste and the way of your task are decisively displayed, which of the included programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP; functions, you must make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all have in common, support & k3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatDVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPref createAudioCDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project obtained via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addurls (KURL:: list urls, Qstring parent) void rameItem (Qstring path, QString newname) void setVoleID (Qstring id) void)</seg>
<seg id="1492">With this, it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT softurl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; select for & kde; with it you can easily record audio CD; s output and stored in MP3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on hard disk) and by many codec that encode these wav files (compression). currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (these codes must still be added from the Linux distribution).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read audio data from the CD; this program is not intended to avoid any copy protection. in any case & kaudiocreator; even do not bypass the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling for reading a & CD will be explained later. this will result (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which Kodiver programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, and everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the site step by step example, there are further information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the setting of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it must be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected for coding instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Open the setup dialog to configure the kind of notifications (such as protocols, spepts) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main direction dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card flashcards (such as encoder, encoder setting), you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can return these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by compressed data depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences are less important as both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not so' free, lame is still included with most distributions for free, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared with OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing ogg playback devices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB flash drive, memory card, hard disk) or special auto hi-fi systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you want to have absolutely the highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information manually entered or fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the coding utility to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoding explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add title to keywords when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters needed (= button title in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information instead of themselves into the calculator. it must be noted that only text is talked about: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (editor's note: with this the author is meant) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being harmed by the CD; however, the information without the CD; more or less worthless, so neither artist nor the music business can be harmed. all information can be obtained from a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively a check box to choose (sending an address). for using freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the entire database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first, if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined encoders. more information on encoders are in the chapter Explore Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). in doing so, 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read genuine on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this won't work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine, as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission for it (eg; by trying to copy something into it by using the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator;, something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD, which needs to be repeated for each reading and CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code to be used for the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program with to download the freedb to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change them at any read of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be passed to the readout program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a view into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here there is not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be loaded / typed as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Just select in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected with the Internet during reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, becomes a & CD; record found, immediately starts reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag records, they can easily be changed. the directory and file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, this is about 620 Mb, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. to freedb in the offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. set it as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work first.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls confirm the 8880 protocol by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to provide any & CD; send data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take over the settings of the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading out the last piece: check this to the & CD; to throw out at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files are created in the private folder. don't forget to make this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances, something has to be blinded to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' to limit the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2 tags can also be deleted when needed. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic set of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, a connection to the Internet is described and set up. first, a connection to the Internet is set up, as we are comfortable and want to pick up the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from those fetched for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of retrieving them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this isn't done yet, now the & CD must be pushed into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search in the section Questions and Answers to Help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; keys for your & CD; a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you haven't selected the check box for automatic selection of freedb (on page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'Update Title' unless you have a composition with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower commentary box can be used for the individual comments inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (for example, whether all words start with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters in the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all the encoding / file formats. see the code to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the CD; in this example, this is not important since we don't transmit the CD; data anyway. for more information go to freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK', return to the main window. just click on the line with the second slice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the actual piece. the title of the piece is definitely and other information you desire.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece. make sure all the pieces are selected, or select the All Pieces on the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When selecting the selection process by clicking on the selection button, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we'll take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left top half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is currently read on the disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see you when you try to work with a cocker you have not yet installed. pieces which have not been successfully codified are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the bottom of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is coded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile from source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls up many different programs has many variations of settings. the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshot of the different map of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke Player of & kde;. besides others, with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of lyrics also some features other & UNIX; -MIDI players don't have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS maps. ALSA is involved as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop to drag & drop; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you & kde; end during playing a song, kmid will start again next time with the same song.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select opening... from the menu file. it appears the usual file dialog, with which help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid window. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the record from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you move it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the template and thus change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu, so stops playing. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text, others use lyrics exterity and again others. some pieces don't have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & mid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the event type automatically determines which one song is used, so you don't have to manually adjust the Karaoke text entry. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select text and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played in the series. in this section, you'll find how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection at the point Organizing.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the respective preferences in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember this when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button Add a song. it again appears in the file dialog, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece when opened (using File Open or Drag & Drop) is automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic added to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the open pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the sub-menu of the menu selection, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the Karaoke Text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the button Next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To skip back a song, select the knob of the previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map is translating General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all of the change patch to Bright Piano events into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, making a trumpet sound whenever a piano originally was to play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary that each occurrence has different textides (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define keymap "Name der keymap"... END define keymap "An additional keymap" END OF CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support may be for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you indicate how the patches of General MIDI are shown on your specific keyboard. the general use is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the rectifier is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patch is in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and also leave blank lines for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to place all sounds that this instrument takes on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard for example does not support a gun (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a rifle shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (rifle shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone means the pitch of the always identical drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify sounds on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to map notes to the percussions channel. take a look at the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will naturally continue to be defined in the file name! if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in what ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch Bender event with the value n, this is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard that will play a pitch Bender event is to play a pitch higher with the value 4096. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones higher up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try it around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the Dialogue MIDI settings. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. the view select in the Settings menu under the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">Tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & mid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have the control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support it has to be compiled. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Disagree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; open on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or go (when I play a karaoke file). in this way, I have to switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file to the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn off the automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so adjust the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to continue to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I'm in the third year, so I do not have much spare time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as a hobby I have program, collect MIDI files, make music and prove sentences.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a lot of joy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will include (if you want it). before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my free time and won't give anyone money for it. I would like to point out that I'm just going to programmer, because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE-cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">I would like to thank Jose Lus Sanchez for the testing of the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net, giving us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">Additionally it can be found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view pictures. you can also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you are using a FM device or an AWE Card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you have to compile & mid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear any music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played down, you should use the Permanent Playlist Category.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups in order to get an additional hierarchy level. when you click on an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the selected entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can be edited by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select the same playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 obd option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up doesn't need to be short, it will automatically stop by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; / bodygt; & lt; / lt; / auto;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the Configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, like the setup of the backend via mimetype. here's an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To allow the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if no errors occur here, the Backend Output within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To ensure that a pre-given backend is taken for a certain mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should return all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog can be used in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introversion, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, source source, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hints how to make my CDROM drive quieter if I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command can be run as root after the device is connected. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom can be found on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for their performance each time?</seg>

<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, use a Laie (English lay) & latex; -macros. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it is derived from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In order to be able to correctly control, good books should be used, e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, which begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again using the\\ end {document} command.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard of & Cile; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in & cile; selecting the wizard (MenÃ ¼) offers some options for creating the document. it can also be made some of the document related settings.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this is the type of document to be created: articles (items), book [book], letter [report], report [report], report (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrbook], projector [beamer], foil [prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Coding: with this, the drawing encoding is set. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; for integration, they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Articles (DIN), Book (DIN), Brief (DIN), Brief (DIN): the documentation classes of KOMA-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). they should always be used in the creation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is simply a short description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Cile; offers - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (and the inappropriate). if you want to see more beautiful areas of a green text on the screen, it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to merge the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set up in the Settings... LaTeX commands are deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the document to be divided into the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files, the back search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI file; file [rendered independent file)] has been created, navigating & cile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; -Source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and other information such as the font and is next to PDF the output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools to view, convert and print DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are bound to the editor, and as soon as an element in the DVI; file was clicked, the corresponding section will jump to the corresponding section in & latex; source code is the exact opposite of it. as soon as you clicked on a section in & latex; -Source text, it will be jumped to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used in working with multiple files. with a master document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick assembly: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is opened to Ã © nderungenâ to the Ã ¼ berwachtâ, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after rapid construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for the quick insertion of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; instructions for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The choice box Further is for inserting articles such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Designation: with this command, a term for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (selection on a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary settings appears. at & bibtex; for editing & bibtex; files are necessary for editing & bibtex; the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field named GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size. the fonts can be set for the main text, the marks, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & cile, there are two options available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and determining the settings. 2. the document can be written from the ground up with the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the\\ 'documentclass command contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the fonts. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is using the MenÃ ¼ s Bauen or Knopfs Quick-bau.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & cile; automatically removes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document fails, it should be searched for errors in the logging process. if fast construction should be started & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font name. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} also allows to outline the fonts within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only covered within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. you can, for example, add certain fonts, fat pressure, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for cursive printing and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed in italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text was presented with the & latex; sign language, a step-by-step guide is now followed for creating a document in & cile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once in the wizard a bit of text was entered, some adjustments should be made for better readability of the document. to do this, at least one quote, some places in fat and cursive printing and a poem can be used to see the differences in these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (for the internal viewer). in case of an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI, file, the same steps are necessary for creating the document (see). in the 7th step, after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed (in the viewer) by printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. as soon as the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search engine allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Cile; provides an appropriate setting for all & latex; files. to do this, only Modern can be set up under Settings Kile... tools building can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To complete the search-search, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then click on pretext search. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the appropriate & latex; -document by & kile; open and jump to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using fast assembly of the & DVI, there may be an error. if there is an error, this will be displayed in the Logging file or in the message box.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file identifies the source of errors in the source code. in the editor, the buttons can then be used in the source code of LaTeX error and most LaTeX error in the editor. to view the wrong line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & kile; jump to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button is clicked in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can be re-written from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Advanced users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents. templates can be created in & cile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file must be created. & kile; can create a new template by scanning an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or drawing encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... General settings are set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by the entry in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps are completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the own template can then be selected instead of the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files are created. if an easy way to create a template is searched, it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be done directly in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Xenical; and to learn about its abilities the manual can be consulted to Kate. users of & cile; can start working there directly by reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Cile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands in & latex; they can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. this means that clicking on\\ par from\\ par\\ bigskip will only be\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Cile; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can capture additional bounce marks. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu item Edit Sprungers or the corresponding key symbol enable the jump to the next or last jump token. this is also highlighted in the case of the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the key aspects of using a program such as & cile; although & kate; already offers outstanding features, have been added to & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code is always supported. under Edit Select the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">This extended significance includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only bending thing in & cile; is that the separation is separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also applies & latex; commands with a backwarping partition (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For listening to a part of the document, it can be selected first and by pressing the Del key. & kate; provides the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & # By removal, the following commands are included for the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has been suggested that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & cile; for more commands under Editing Environment for possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to protect the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview of the environment can quickly be lost. this command completes the last opened environment, so that the nested ambient structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Cile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by clamps {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to the editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumped at the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumped at the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the curled clip of a & tex; group #, the other end of the group is sprayed (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">With the input of many nested curly curly brackets, the overview can quickly be lost. this command completes the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple reference marks are used as a link. for the beneficial implementation it is used in & cile; the character is "used for two simple designation." and for the end of the application, the character is "used."</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic double-stop sign can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used to specify specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and therefore German or French quotation marks. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shifting from Shift; Enter & kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not just a line break but at the same time the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, close & kile; the current line with\\\\ with an adjacent line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & ile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be found under Settings... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users would like to arrange columns in tables -surroundings and all the Et characters (amp;) among each other. & kile; try to make this possible. when using Shift; Alt; amp; searches & kile; after the next tab in the current line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already a good source code completion, it has been added in & cile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;) it has been added. three of them work according to demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different modes of operation...</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} command, & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">At the back of the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and may be diluted by the completion list. on the other hand, the list can also be reduced by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command. alternatively, bounce brands can be frozen so that an easy jump to these positions is possible with Edit Sprungbrands NÃ ¤chste sprint marker is possible and the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Settings cile; set up... kile; complete settings can be made to these lists. you can select different kinds of preferences for & tex; - and & latex; -Commands and utilities of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters to be entered with\\ begin and the completion mode will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for the completion of the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking a complete environment or the Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient noise can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is executed.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Setting up, setting up... kile; adjustments can be made to these lists. this mode uses the option list of complete recovery mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Cile; supports user-defined lists of cuts that are immediately replaced by long strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... tile files can be set up. as an example of a check list, the file example.cwl, in which the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is introduced over the volume, or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt space bar, the letter L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large doors are not helpful for automatic completeness. however, it has been established that many users in one document are written more than once. this provides & cile; the completion for all already written users.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the MenÃ ¼ Settings Kile... tile expandable. here you can also set the treshold for the display of completion.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / of the personal home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialogue charts are designed to create graphics as easy as possible. to view the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be highlighted.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as popular as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for the changes and reorders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be reordered with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted using ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to assess the outcome of the work, the source code must be compiled. all construction tools are grouped together in the MenÃ ¼ s creating compiling, creating and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & Eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard input Alt; 2. then, the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file in a PS file and be watched by old; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick-Engineering command, a viewer is usually called after the compilation. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will pop up every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is being conducted over the MenÃ ¼ ube project.... This includes the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When filling the filename window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows the execution of ECMAScript code. scripts can be administered over scripts in vertical bars.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of & cile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & ile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a fairly smart system in which basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages. & ile; provides a lot of different aids to support the users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; they are delivered with a lot of documents, including a documentation for the packages and a more & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete manual for the & latex; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a particular formatting. since it is a very large document, it is divided into & tile; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / textual; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help, & tetex; / textual; the small application texdoctk on, containing a database with all of the available documents and for a graphical surface.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or strokes. from & kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we begin with the Edit menu menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog enables you to manage all of the plugins included and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. if you add plug-ins without a location & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project multiple people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the indication of team members and they can be configured using Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member out of the list and selecting the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold to which they are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and your own identity are important with regard to news and comments. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by recording the members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leader when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is happening in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that enters the CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the side event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Insert notes is easy. either the comment entry can be selected from the Editor context menu, or the @ annotation keyword can be entered in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the pointed nickname of the team member, is part of the project as part of the area and sub-project leaders, as shown in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, which is DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here, only about & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the other can be found.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using the Quanta setting... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; with regard to tags including car completion can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Big / Small-write of tags: big / umpy of automatically entered tags. normal / lower case means the tags are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically entered attributes. normal / lower case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically close: if checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not automatically include optional tags: as above for all other tags, with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and end tag: when switched on, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls automatic conversion of accent characters into appropriate coding during tipping.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetyps for the detection of different types of files. using the Default button, the default specifications can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened as with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting will be ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is displayed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a map), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings on the default to the next start is useful when the user interface comes through changing the MDI modes and andocking / dependency of views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the possibility of switching warnings by hooks of no more questions.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source text view in shared mode. regarding the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree displaying the picture of the parser nodes in the document can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible, which can be changed by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons triggered.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Settings section, the visibility of knots in the tree can be set automatically when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins can be managed here. plug-ins are the third party applications that can be reused by any part-enabled application, the best known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin, if it is not at a standard location like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Loading Component in "Read Only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only Lese-KParts normally refuse to load if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, testing & quantaplus; if the given information is correct. selecting allows saving the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. the support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, which allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plug-in is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the button Options next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the debugger's supported features, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which needs a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server in order to initiate a debug request. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Tells the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a request is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Displays the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger takes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger execute the next command in the script, where it is possible to get in functions and include error-adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can input a variable or set a new value to a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you & quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how to help & quantaplus; help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document Type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for markup and scripting languages as well as CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folders and toolbars. tag folders are handy, symbolised bars of image buttons (above the editing pane), which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for tag displays. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares that they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users may have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but it contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; an argument of function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid for class class only. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the class name where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Set a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editing dialog, and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface name and method name. the arguments passed to the method may be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current Tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A box tag summarizes the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">There is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is an element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this element is an element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; start window and select TagxML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, the check only occurs when the TagXML files are loaded into & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following, an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD processor DTD settings. thus diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for any higher version. name = DTD (/ / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional).</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... are created. clicking New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The button shortcut assigned to this action. with clicking the user defined button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the different see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way tries & quantaplus; the script to find in the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will replace the current document URL. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus process; if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text will be unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods described above, a script can input from & quantaplus; to receive the default input. in the input field input, you can determine what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages, set to the default output.</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create their own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the Markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self explanatory. pressing the New Action knob at the bottom end of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable "Edit Tag" dialog when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we & kipedit; use. select from the & KMenu;, Graphics more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kipedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually set as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user is signalled that clicking on this symbol is & lt; startr; tag in the current document is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions to set... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus functions to the toolbar, or it should be shared for a better overview by some dividers into multiple groups. open the toolbar to set the toolbar for the toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the divider supports the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the new toolbar must be tested by masturbating all the symbols to ensure that everything works." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">After New XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) is loaded when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you prefer. therefore, this chapter describes how to create an & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you have to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documents Section 1 = Section1.html Sec3.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec3.2 = Section1.html Sec3.2 = Section1.html Sec3.2 = Section1.html tag1 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html tag2 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in PHP, documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and logical next to the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the range of the docrc file which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of delimited context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your file docrc and adhere to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you indicated in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different locations there is an menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a contribution we recommend signing the resources, for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New Resource must pass the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and with clicking OK the upload will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), uploading toolbars, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears stating the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages that are not currently supported by & quantaplus; however, creating a DTEP package can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files might be necessary in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Start menu and conversion a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target Name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions: the string that reads in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand and understand the full benefit from & quantaplus, you must first familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and projected. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; used, available. by toolbars about actions, all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to backup different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all of & CSS; samples up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editor window, the architectural views, the map guides with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the card driver with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all card drivers, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmarks or executing CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area lead to another context menu concerning the edited document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the tags under the mouse cursor, help the word under the mouse cursor or open the file, if the string under the mouse-cursor identifies a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window, the toolbars of the editor are located. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard, for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in various fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Baumanviews (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate, open it and roam. in the presentation with learning flashers are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete files from the storage media can be done using the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus work area. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only available in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of breakdown in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. using the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as to start, edit or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, many attributes and namespaces can be changed. the application system, which is aligned with the content, allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">You can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two boxes at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This card driver displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This card driver shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus; to define.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure it in & quantaplus; like any other backup and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. therefore, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a full list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not run here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far along the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of Why develop, what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus to expand as they need it for their need.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from the clipboard to & URL; write, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Enables you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if you & PHP; -script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scriptactions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Outgoing and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the icon column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents will appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows, for example, to copy video files to your project folder or sub-folders and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde, and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; managed the project. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects can be explained the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project dir / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set by settings actions... are added. toolbars are stored on the toolbar toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. this will not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, wherever everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities are to be refreshed from the DTEP without rebuilding the whole & DTEP. if this is global and is not present in the global KDE folder, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, in the Tags Menu there is a sub-menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the menu item, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or disables the smart insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quantaplus; inserting by toolbar if this tag contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugin menu, the available plug-ins are listed in the menu items above. click on it. clicking on an activated plugin will disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the date; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate changeover between the different types of the user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, changeover sometimes might need time or cause unnice graphics. the map mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting a contract, the appropriate subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect every application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; -web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Directs the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you delete entries from the toolbars or which you can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the mouse pointer's environment, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self explanatory and should be filled in the best way from above, since, for example, after filling the project name, the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all of these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties Tab.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can specify the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let's be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are supposed to be included. if a project is started from scratch, don't hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub-window profile or Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the button Options. in this case, troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for each profile's content, using a specific tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindows project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project opens and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files can be found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programing. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on disk storage option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server's name on which the files should be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear wave, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, that is, by simply sharing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, which can be accessed, opened or deleted by the Toolbar Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; with which you have the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to your own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus; best customizable via the Toolbar menu. usage and Addition vary. adding toolbars will be treated below in the Add-Toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbars can be rename or toolbars can be set, which can be displayed in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries action will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up toolbars in the menu with settings... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essential documents skeletons, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you set for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information on the Template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specialized documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. one makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree among global templates. see for more information on the Template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area repeatedly in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl based. see for more information on the Template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates for full web sites serve as templates. they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure as you like (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As a template save as local template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save selected selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection may be dragged along with dragging and placing on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a default folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files you can click on a folder on the right and create a site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved just as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically link with & PHP; create, paste or link with them. additionally, you can keep a lot of things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as the attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">If a root folder would be set, it would generally disable templates in this path except they would be explicitly activated. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows preceded or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project, and by copying contents to a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have to use context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection to add folders, copy and paste from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that is accessible via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the branch divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor functions as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back when needed to source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; it displays a small green symbol the default code of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP, it is still necessary to change the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and the VPL; editor synchron. with pressing F9 this mode is activated, this mode is already active, the keystrokes the active cursor from a window to the other, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Quanta.... According to VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatic. in principle, the time span can be set automatically when selecting VPL. basically, the recommendation applies: a small margin for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The document properties dialog is called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; the document properties dialog is called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons down. a click into the list allows to change the contents, e.g. keywords on the column name and keywords keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating the appearance of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS compliance with the buttons below the list. a change on the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as in a word processor, moving with arrows. in rare circumstances, the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using the back button or the remover button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way across the toolbars as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously existing identical tags will not be removed, for example if an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the Table Wizard or the Listen wizard are disabled. they will later work in the VPL; function, in this release the tables or lists must be used toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & diff3;? let me explain briefly what I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time fixed the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts while merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text fast, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful if two persons work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screen image shows three source files while merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& diff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& diff3; shows the exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are shown visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder er1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder er1 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder er2 folder 3 kdiff3 folder folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog enables manually typing filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the open dialog notes your selection and displays it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be introduced. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the abort button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes, a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, you in & kdiff3; download and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can do nothing & diffuse; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then, a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color for that is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the summary column from the text is interrupted at the points where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has an info line with the inscription Edition:, the filename and [changes] when you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference at the same time is a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manually edit; then, in these lines the text & lt; No line in the queue; no row in the queue; this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting sources ignoring the numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate the keyboard to the left, right, high, down, side up, start, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you are used by other programs. the oversight column next to the vertical image bar can also be used for navigating.</seg>
<seg id="2316">You can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insertion key, you can switch between insert mode and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarizing columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / first / last difference, to the next / last difference (Ctrl-picture backwards / Ctrl image downwards) or to the next / last unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). there is also the option selection automatically. if this is enabled, then whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the clipboard and manually copy the manual copying. however, be careful with this option, because you could overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-feed character\, and Win32-based systems use the carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line endings of the source files, so you should not use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically when it is finished and restored at the next start. (Menu settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered rendered. on these systems, the button presets automatically creates an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the previous line indentation is automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, every selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard, and then manually copy it to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white signs are not ignored. even when merging white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others only store a newline '\', but then files with different sizes may look identical in page-to-side comparison though they are different.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even minor differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic expansion mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white marks are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the chapter for scanning folders and performing merging. see Documentation for Comparison and Combination for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if you already have such a backup file with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you have to restart & restart, so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for coding appears a short note of what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding to save is to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to specify the coding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">(note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. by selecting A & lt; -gt; B, A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. merging current file in the merge menu will also work if you just compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is passed to this external command. if also a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users don't want to program it by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line deviation to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergulary expression of the text found on each string and in this context all characters are listed in one line. the\\ U transforms the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, a pre-processing command for line matching removes the possible keywords. you can change the list as needed. the\\ before the $is necessary because $is a special character and the end of the line would mean.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for line comparisons. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER 'Allerdings are different with perl some details. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for viewing and merging. other operations only change the data that the line-like algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that alters the text or hidden differences, you may accidentally fail to notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a suggestion for merging; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with the selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no target folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message window on current progress. if you cancel the folder scan, only the files that were compared to that time are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & diff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually shown folded. you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories, and all subdirectories that you can open or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be notified about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. in folders, age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colours of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copying from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B): errors: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The syncing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option directories are synchronised, then selects & kdef3; the necessary action to be followed after both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & diff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option to select a new file instead of merging (unsure) is checked, then an error message appears: files are different but the date is identical. if such errors are not fixed, the merge of the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, a file is processed after the other. it shows the status column when merging has been successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected arises. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is fine anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts will only appear when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge either the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all matching actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have a destination folder, then C is used as the target in the three-folder merge mode, and B is selected as the target while the two-folder merge mode is selected and when syncing, A and / or B will be used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries that should be in the target folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select the folder merge / continue in the folder menu, or press F7 (the key shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merge actions by conflicting file types, a message appears to indicate the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (see the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select the folder merge to start / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When you make a mistake, a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you skip the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in any other way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, the entries (in the current session) will not be remerged. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be completed. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings menu - &gt; Account Settings...) now has a section called Folder merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be typed more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be typed more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this can be set to a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems a precursor stand. a file is hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In case of links to folders: when the option is disabled, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not on possible recursions).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and significantly slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-sample.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders to a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. for example, this can be useful when copying the change date. please use caution when copying. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates syncing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are any differences, instead of merging the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is off-default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and gets the extension .original If an old backup file exists with the .orig -extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of single files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view is visible during the merge of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want to, you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to launch the folder merge. you can also merge a single file directly, without first having to launch the folder merge. to do this, the status is set to first and the file will not be merged when you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost if you re-read the directory again: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening that are on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # contains URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of restrictions:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link will show a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date vary from the original. (this is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts always the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in Kdiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">If it is applied as a part, it takes & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then & kdef3; the patch program will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview from the context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. moreover, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When playing a part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in Part Mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's hot) are already available. in addition, the name KDiff3 already indicates that merging can be like the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably don't have the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this kind is dependance but this clis often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notices every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too big so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src sweeps; appeared and the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& diff3; use already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the functions of & kdef3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of last changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdef3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdef3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have problems with compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) Copy to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-paste) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folders with the Update button.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also leads to the fact that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when they merge. if the target folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop, change their size, stop them or shift them. this works both within a working area as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; move. the movement is possible both within a working area and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries Pager set up... and Finish. if however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, Work Desktop and End.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, the & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field leaves the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is intersected together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty work surfaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically lets & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as known from pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontal displays all virtual desktops in a horizontal row, which is very good for representation on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, displaying and panning windows as symbols or with their content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager, and set up selections of switch... lets the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you don't have any write permission for the file, you must login as a user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package cdebase, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor remains in the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, if you suffer from pain that is related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">In order to clarify it once again, even if it helps to avoid pain caused by moving the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click as soon as you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart shift is activated, it makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement, before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can pull the pulling with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool, executing a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligible shift is enabled, the shooting range is activated (1 / 10 s). the time is set, the & kmousetool; after the mouse button is shut down, the mouse button is closed again, if no moving of the mouse happens in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking the mouse shift. if this function is activated, a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. this movement is saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, when & kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select there Sound System and here the tab General. there's a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, the & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">All settings are reset to the values that were set when the dialog is opened. if you have already pressed the user button, the settings are reset to the standby after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off at first. if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later remove the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of what position a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that do not constitute a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd need to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute even a mouse click. hereby, the status of & kmousetool is reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shift, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool, and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely possible in this way to mark text, copy it to the clipboard and re-insert or execute any other action at which you want to move the mouse in pressed mouse button. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart shift if you just start using & kmousetool; instead, simply select a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this means that every time & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the smart shift starts using the delay time. later, you can use the smart shift without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; to be able to use the XTest add-on for & X Window; this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers, and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor persists. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI's syndrome and the antigen of the brightest pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the speech "speech-Dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the subdued orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can chat with & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you initiate from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues except the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen Readers while & ktts; just one of them reads, this output will stop and terminate.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can still be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be supplied with pre-defined list of strings that enable the creation of Chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for re-formatting messages from & conversing; or & kmail; in a better understood form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; if you have chosen a female voice on the board of cards, you can read the text of KDE news about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is used for voice output. if the filter states that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, a warning or a & kde message is sent, it is processed by all enabled filters installed on the page below. the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the set-up normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of the filter, and the subsequent installation dialogs are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">If these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list of a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to view a list of languages.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs can be obtained using the qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied 3432 indicates, you may only copy the copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The filter changer filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box will apply this filter if matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison to words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separating characters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can add it to the dialogs adding or editing as help to compile these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">& XML; translate & XML; using XSLT files from a format into another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such implementations. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker Set filter, you can send texts to a specific speaker installed on the Board of Cards, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts, specify a text to the filter, it searches for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected according to the speaker characteristics, which presets the program that sends the text to & ktts; the speaker is selected by the Speaker select filter.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If there is a value here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is on your system the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it with one click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The selection filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box will apply this filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; deformerfilter, but when using the module for festival, web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in festival 1.95 beta you need to install the (male) voice Rab _ diphone so that SABLE works at all. you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages. also, make sure the program xsltproc is installed and found via the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain notes or punctuation marks appear to cause mistakes in the synthesizer, so that whole sentences are skipped or only chewing waveforms. what can I do about it?</seg>

<seg id="2677">The speech speech "speech-Dispatcher" uses an adaptable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you would like to broaden your use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or newer), including packages kdelibs and the development files for the speech "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to the source code of & ktts; refer to the source code archive for cdedness or have downloaded the tarball each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts, check first whether speech scheduler works correctly with your speech synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program ttmsg should be developed in such a way that the device is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can go back, repeat or cancel state- or paragraph styles, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise it will automatically be selected the best fitting voice. if you want to learn more about how & tts; select a speaker, you will be looking for.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add Spokesperson on the Board of Cards, and in order to add a narrator to the list, or click Edit, the Card Card Speaker Set is displayed. for example, the installation of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. details of the modules can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text handed to the festival. if voices, the & ktts are known, this setting will be performed automatically. generally speaking, western languages use ISO 8859-1 to use eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some regulator and show this grey, the voice you choose doesn't allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so that the first set is synthesized faster with larger memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window kttsmgr will appear at the start of ttsmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the icon ttsmgr will be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ttsmgr doesn't work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions, which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message. & ktts; processes four kinds of speech applications:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. after the output of the screen reader has been read, the subdued orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can with & mouth; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">When a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a Screen Readers, it inserts & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voice, speaking speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch. also, brands for controlling the pronunciation of the voice, for example abbreviations. SSML is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, the festival used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limit detection filters (SDB filters). this can & ktts; faster with pre-reading, because only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set of rules recognition filters. at the first start of & ktts, a set of rules recognition filters is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add further proposition recognition filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to do this is to set up the speaker selection by selecting. switch on the Speaker's selection and select which speaker & ktts. switch on the Speaker's selection, change some features and check how the choice of the speaker changes. you need to have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster to start reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the entire text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the speech synthesizer doesn't support this function, you can pause or cancel jobs on the card charts.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the regular set detection filter is automatically set up when you start ttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only be removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and append a tabulation mark (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulation marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set-limit detection filter will retain the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the standard code detection filter from distortion, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc included in & tts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the Speaker's settings for the application on the menu card Speaker selection. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top one on board map speaker). in other words: no speaker characteristics are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker that has all the characteristics of an established speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & tts; otherwise select & ktts; select the speaker that best matches the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the subscriber you want. if this feature does not matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other features. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a primary attribute. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In order to use all the properties in the narrator section, which is most likely to be deleted, click on the Default button and then use the speaker that is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I do not get tracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and & ktts; you probably need to register GStreamer. with GStreamer 0.8.x the command is follow-0.8. if the problem is not solved this may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I hold a text order, freezes & tts; one. on the & Console; appears a message that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, please refer to the ALSA project (dmix) on www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I have installed them and can use them in festival, but kttsmgr doesn't show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / apps / kttsd / festivalint / apps / kttsd / festivalint / VoIP address. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL; where you found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed and discoverable via the PATH environment variable. some Synthesizermoduls like Festival Interactive offer themselves a setting for speed on the board map for speaker setup. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivation either the filter for conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML reform filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag SABLE GENDER does not seem to work. to make festival no mistakes, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tag to convert SSML to Saber. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a custom label filter and now I can proceed in & ktts; not prescribing or withdrawing any more. on the map of the map, orders are displayed, the order consist only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You are not allowed to filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a filter for punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or newer. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling in & ktts before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer.freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in audio output. if your system also counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktts; also freezes when you hold a text order and then start another. you can find possible solutions for this problem on the ALSA website (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode still does not support real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current sentence will be read before.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speech speed, but is not necessarily required. Debian users can install sox using the apt-get install sox command. the program is already included on most & Linux; CD's already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">Once downloaded as tarball (with tar-packed archive), log in as a normal user and unpack the tarball into a matching folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed, or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for speech synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2765">The default setting is & ktts; in / opt / kde3 installed. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify the --prefix = target. for example</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before you use & ktts, check first if your speech synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you received using the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is disclosed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. you can find help in the manuals supplied with festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male) voice Rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unzip the software in festival / lib / Vox / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone for the voices. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look at the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the code must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the option code must be set to 8-bit Cyrillic such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA; synthesizer. then Festival takes over lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it generates the audio output from it. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloffener Voice synthesizer written in & Java; i.e. you need to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java, neither pitch, volume, nor speaking speed can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & tts; any voice synthesizer, which can be controlled in a console, can be controlled on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">Best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows managing the network interfaces, routing, and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & controlcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; for the user, create a simple interface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed at & kcontrolcenter; the network settings (knetworkconf) module can be selected by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured, so & knetworkconf; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option network settings are selected at the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the hand selection will be offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and released. selecting non-re-requests can be made permanently. when the network settings are started, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are gray displayed, meaning the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. in the system administrator mode, you can enter the system administrator mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the whole module's functionality is available. it is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed from the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... to be edited in the Dialogue device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. clicking the Advanced Settings button displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are performed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at any system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the select manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface in the boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as the characteristics of the device in the list of devices.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Depending on the needs, network devices can be enabled or switched off. switching to a switched-off network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Depending on the needs, network devices can be enabled or switched off. switching an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specify the host's IP address in the local subnet that mediates physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator will allow you to easily manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. entries can be added to the list by selecting a single entry and listing or downgrading in the list with the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking the button Add... from the batch calculator to name resolution can be added to a DNS server. it will be added to the New nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group computer to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list named calculator describes hostname to IP address references to the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of known computers contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still-in-test version of IP should replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known host and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will display.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well known hostname and click the Add button. if the well-known machine has multiple alias names, press the button to add multiple times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known to name from the list and select Edit... The dialog Configuring Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system. to activate the changes, you need to set the following command.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkbab.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), when & kde, and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical user interface such as kpackage or the installation tool for their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile network.conf. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second part all of the & knetworkconf; variable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely distributed. IPv6 is expected to see it in the near future. this description is therefore currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at the & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact point, which has a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically in DSL links, so it will not be surprised if in the event of active DSL links another content can be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in SuSE. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first consisted in creating a surface for tar, which also offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it has to be done by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; retrains the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects & kdat; if you do not notice the prestressing of the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat; the prestressing, searches for the right index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smooth, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was incorporated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched for the band through unfolding the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejection of the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; returns with a change of the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be thrown out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive requires that a tape has to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can be formatted by the band of & kdat. floppy tape drives usually do not require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity & kdat; with the format of the tape continues. all data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a fuse profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Mark files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so-selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select in the Save Menu...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens up Settings for Backup. in this dialog, you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box appears. dialogue shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Rightclick on one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout process has been started, the dialog appears for review. in this dialog, you can review your selection once again and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for the review, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files to be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or sub-folder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Rightclick a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog, you can review your selection once again and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the recovery settings, the dialog appears. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file on the basis of the belt content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a fuse profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up in the same file system as the folder. folders on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to ascertain the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the invocation of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons is & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings on the KDat menu... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding variant of the tape machine.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command meshes load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; to block the ejection from the tape drive. possibly, this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape is automatically disconnected. don't use this option for floppy streams.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, attempts & kdat to change the hardware-based block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to tell & kdat; in any case, tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape format, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(N Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the complete name of the system on which the volume was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the volume was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot: functions available to easily filter and sort the protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog, first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will open. if you don't see it, and it opens instead of a small message window, you have & ksystemic log; very likely not having system administrator rights. the protocol files usually do not have authorization to read in the folder / var / log, for the normal user.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or after input strings. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so that only log lines appear next to the filter. in the default setting, the selection field contains the entry All. then, a protocol row is displayed only if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column. for example, in the Protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the filterstrip; all protocol-lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol rows. protocol rows of step errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as a protocol-line of the stage hint. the colored display of protocol rows can be shut down in the direction dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only a specific process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this may be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window's context menu to display all new Add-In-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemic log; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemic log; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further up-to-date information about the reference sources of & ksystemic log;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemic log; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: knative log; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system quickly develops into the standard for program start-up when starting the system in the & Linux; world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not below / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to system V init without installing a new installation and reformatting. Linux; kernel first looks under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc directly in / etc. this folder is named rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you run the system or switch to another runlevel.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should in / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you come to fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no proper files. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called up with the argument. if it contains an S, the script is called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; start.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six runways to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level while pulling it somewhere else. this is done only if it removes an entry from the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them into a new section. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and enter the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown in the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to hit a selection above or below previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it by cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they are restored by & ksysv; changes to default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is starting to reboot. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; run level varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry saving in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two maps, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the user or group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map maps are displayed only if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space restrictions (quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings. additional flashcards appear, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card file password management appears, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd, as installed in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map will only appear if a limited file system (Quota) is enabled and initialized (identifiable at the quotas user / quotas group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the space limitations specified in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the field limitation with the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The board map groups informs about the group affiliates of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group. furthermore, the user can be member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu, or click the Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group functions analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
