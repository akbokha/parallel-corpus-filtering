although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run their sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I mainly became a journalist because of an American movie .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ates with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as a law student .
I was tra@@ pped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admi@@ ration for the USA had only intensi@@ fied .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ened letter of love about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never holds behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can election was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominated candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person ?
I couldn &apos;t reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from all over the world , a deep @-@ believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung also agreed not to the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
d@@ umps In@@ tolerance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump paved his way to nomin@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confron@@ tation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and implies an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those elec@@ tors , most of whom are white , voted for a tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note of the Ü ) : as much as &quot; revol@@ t against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; pu@@ n white in all@@ usion to white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , what the big Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump@@ et , however , a huge portion of the white America gives up this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
the crowd replied with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if anyone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump@@ ing@@ land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and this breaks me my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through rub@@ b@@ ish
the Recy@@ cled Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large land@@ fill site , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial town that is popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( musical band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and the gangs of violence .
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare ray of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with gle@@ aming eyes and playing in the hu@@ stle they learn to play trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , Wald@@ horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recy@@ cl@@ ers began to turn parts of the waste into instruments under direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion all made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the beginning :
at first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish . the children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from litter .
today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic waste dump ) shows the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
fill harmony follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices , re @-@ release takes place for shared use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly anger@@ ed and little inclined to welcome a law @-@ break@@ er of this kind on their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles were swi@@ ft@@ ly mobili@@ zing themselves against the ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority , is a member of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia due to the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had then exp@@ elled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are now in real time , with trace@@ able on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news of susp@@ icious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas . such susp@@ icious driving routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship carries its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such investigations may show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to reg@@ ain estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
among other things , such practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , giving of phant@@ asy seeds , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically exploit the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i now .
until now , the closed front functions .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
because of its co @-@ operation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , FISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he builds a system that aims to help FISH @-@ i to detect susp@@ icious ships more precisely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to detect the illegal ships that are happy to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , which can no longer be used by satellites .
for this reason , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is supposed to help FISH @-@ i find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing World@@ watch platform with Google and the marine protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of every single track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; join with the neighbours to get a better picture of who does what &apos;s doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and consoli@@ date their resources into the investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run where a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them .
ships that previously conf@@ is@@ cated without license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences know now that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in the FISH @-@ i have meanwhile reported a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after FISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there tu@@ g nets on board , whose use is forbidden .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
other countries also notice these successes . &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries are now also copying , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing .
there have been six countries united in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fish@@ eries , according to exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; With safety the goal is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia could report its first major triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under a false flag . and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used to@@ wing networks that are now prohibited .
the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country were running into the void while meeting on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example , the rein@@ de@@ generation of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located district of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the Federal State of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the daily life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance for a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; however , the relu@@ ct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , Contributors of Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government decision in her latest article :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the rate of inflation is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Diam@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called on the demonstr@@ ators to join the National Assembly on 27 October , and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an Government , was scheduled to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is time for Venezuela : tomorrow &apos;s National Assembly , Friday national civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the scope of the Action Programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the March published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures which tell about arguments , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts did not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people in the street .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little action against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to keep critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied against his father in the large La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba .
in the trial that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were examined .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , the tort@@ urer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a civil servant . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was in prison La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , charged with kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 counts and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who over the years realized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the base of the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall .
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you &apos;re an as@@ sh@@ ole , you &apos;ve been friends with an ERP .
just make sure that she won &apos;t be kidn@@ apped one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the gymn@@ asi@@ um . a few days later he took me to work on the base of the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine .
at the base of the military base , I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

the prisoners are tort@@ ured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver inside it .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen items were put down and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I sp@@ ed in and saw a couch that was tort@@ ured by man .
it looked like a bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they put on the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was tied up there .
they seldom bind a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ cast him with water , and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the smell there was terri@@ fic ... like a fil@@ thy win@@ dle .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can harm another so much harm ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were hand@@ cu@@ ffed and became blin@@ d@@ folded .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people rested quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me back ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero had a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to data from survivors , the civilian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came here is also the way on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this way and then tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later in the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ onet or perhaps military @-@ sign that one takes away an enemy that one has fought against .

but if you go into a house and steal the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , sm@@ ote me and cried :
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
this is how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a jum@@ per pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last dre@@ ad@@ ful act &apos;
now that I am older I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . once children have children , one realis@@ es the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why have the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do kids kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them in prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why leave their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to pass over their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act you can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were gro@@ unded and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of displaying my father was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I accused him of all the atro@@ cities I had to witness for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patriot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed horri@@ ble crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he just replies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can blame me for having been bi@@ ased . I have finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the verdi@@ cts in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended sentences of life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ mission &apos;s verdi@@ ct : murder , torture and rape by ministers .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization founded in 1995 , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research for that took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial site led by human rights organisations .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can extend his driving licence .
the photograph was circul@@ ated in social media .
edit the original photo of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving lic@@ ences , witnessed a particularly un@@ successful translation in the last month .
on one of the labels , the Japanese word &quot; ( kor@@ ei@@ sug@@ sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; was wron@@ g@@ ly - perhaps also with malicious h@@ ul@@ lab@@ y &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from September 1 to 20 on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photo of Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made the local newspapers aware of it .
the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , appearing in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could such a translation come from ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said .
the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , al@@ beit gramm@@ atically not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake was already included in the text that they had received from the translator , and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger informed as follows about the excuse :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely ap@@ ologi@@ ze that elderly people felt off@@ ended by inadequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News took a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved nation@@ ally in accidents , but is quite an occasion to worry .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 sen@@ iors were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the particularly un@@ named rep@@ orter brought comments on the light published on Yahoo in the article published on Yahoo , showing what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently are against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo across the translation error received , among other things , the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So mis@@ er@@ ably the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold .
for translation , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge , to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires an active rule of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally speaking , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate the English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost jumps or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies who do not have foreign employees can nevertheless make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ User Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences which are produced by machine translation show that this technology cannot replace human trans@@ lators for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the wei@@ r@@ dest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ or@@ ship actions on the Internet and TV take
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would not have access to the online Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups opposing Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests started in early April after the Supreme Court resolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was known and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ or@@ ship : enables your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ an people with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been relu@@ ct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server will answer requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server will reply faul@@ ty or refuse the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third @-@ locked channel , was suspended on Thursday 6 April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was put into custody .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on air again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testimon@@ ies from other Cri@@ mean people who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of structural design .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying Co@@ ws , falling schools &quot; ) edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as a cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay there are more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work in order to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another more wealthy family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over her head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be abol@@ ished .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay as a result of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testimon@@ ies , resear@@ ching and den@@ oun@@ cing .
she tried to name things by the name , as the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ p@@ pled the Cri@@ mean is generally not to be silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and can &quot; make something out &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies his exploitation by believing that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not get education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only experience it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the bor@@ rowing in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of the former military hospital Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra continued with a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered a fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society bl@@ ac@@ kl@@ ed practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there would be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a swi@@ ft investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Job@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to register bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all the way and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time so that she was still time to learn .
she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer .
for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned up the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she was finished with learning , the more leisure she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the library of the house than food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
on some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read edi@@ t@@ orials from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I was going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their masters feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , and explained them .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she had from them , with their hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about is mo@@ b@@ bing and the har@@ ass@@ anes that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ te .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertis@@ ements for cleaning staff and child girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrators are Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little girl for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to yourselves .
starting from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ñ@@ u@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ u@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author once again turned out to be :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you , I write again if something is .
the shop was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long else ? ) , a collection of testimon@@ ies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we succeeded in abol@@ ishing systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í were ens@@ la@@ ved and subjected to their &quot; wives &quot; ) , and the system of the Mens@@ a ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were given tribute to them ) and the system of slavery , in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill Writ@@ es Egyptian users of social media to sign up with the government
Pix@@ ab@@ ay image , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
released under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would be set up , mand@@ ated by citizens to use a permit to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register with their correct names and ID numbers on the site , in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a cash bu@@ ck .
the bill , composed of six par@@ agra@@ ph@@ s and cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video news and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are able to impose the registration . it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ r Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around fac@@ ebook . because of this , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research T@@ echnolog@@ ist ( in German &quot; leading research technolog@@ ist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative für Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any agency in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as law , the draft must first be discussed at the Leg@@ is@@ l@@ ative of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it comes to the plen@@ ary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was en@@ vis@@ aged for those who are found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest against protests . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activists H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and their team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the g@@ ho@@ stly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who ro@@ am through Africa and Asia are among the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ olor ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish E@@ cos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem is also dependent on a large pre@@ dat@@ or .
when the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist Raz@@ a passi@@ on@@ ately likes to show a different side of her country , which is not only made up of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

early March 2017 , the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for North East Japan , documented the progress made over the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; three @-@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was an et@@ ly pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , experiencing both the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture saw a nuclear accident , even so , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows what progress has been achieved six years after the local point of view to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese Re @-@ building Authority and the survey results of those concerned themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( for the con@@ stru@@ cts of some , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate Pre@@ fec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ation of Beh@@ el @-@ houses ( to the old , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) was to be reloc@@ ated to final substitute houses .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such houses .
nearly 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of evacu@@ ated people who were hau@@ led after disaster in temporary homes were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by disaster , re@@ opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 per cent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have suffered large areas in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of ag@@ r@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the farm land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the &quot; nuclear locking zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only be 75 percent here .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers find it more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . it asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their perception has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that there has still not been enough in dis@@ asters prevention .
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also stepped up its attention to the location of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been reloc@@ ated to permanent replacement homes .
according to the 2017 stand , there are still 4@@ 0,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ates that still live in Beh@@ el @-@ shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they are well @-@ known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .

when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the common@@ alities .
after a while , however , one often realis@@ es that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode from In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we discuss issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Veron@@ ika Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike has consolidated its aff@@ ection to the Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa rec@@ alls the lack of common language skills during a trip in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nation@@ wide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was handed over to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia with a stick against his head . nation@@ wide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of G@@ oi@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him on Saturday and moved him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures , the police officer &apos;s face can also be seen , which attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state G@@ oi@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active ministry until the examination of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs are rus@@ hing to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another federal state , Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in G@@ oi@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls on further violence against activists in G@@ oi@@ ás :
G@@ oi@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been murdered by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group had been sabot@@ aged by a gas le@@ ak . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a polic@@ eman who hit him with a stick in his face .
police Hand@@ les
G@@ oi@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers used rubber floors and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers .
the member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , a social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud@@ speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again Brazilian media has covered street protests by direc@@ ting the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to decorate their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a brand @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be acknowledged if you are strictly against any form of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confron@@ tation with the police . &quot;
Cuba &apos;s Un@@ for@@ ging villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ y@@ nos@@ o law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular church Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after dro@@ wning , the sugar cane industry was still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities , until only the frame of steel and concrete remained .
around 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for the country to worry a few decades ago , but the bad harvest is no longer a new one .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and they were hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
however , the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; issued by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agr@@ arian and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate approximately $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane plants , over 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats the most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents , which were distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by El@@ ise Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane plants that were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial sector of Cuba and most important wor@@ shi@@ ppers has been eradi@@ cated .
in many cases , there have been no alternatives for the jobs and services the facilities generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the president at that time saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .

after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather said than they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ate the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people once again left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , the production of which is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and a clear voice , is not a night @-@ bearing person , but he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have been tort@@ uring him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to retirement at 65 years , not because he is lacking strength , but because he is bitter .

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo courtesy of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then partner@@ ed with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Star .
the workshop begins with the fact that the young participants learn topics like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever happens to them .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the strain of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &apos; Highway of tears &apos; , a road section in West Canada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alisation is .
many of the songs were published in indigenous languages , although the you@@ ths did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel as if nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take away our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comments section the readers and supporters of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and add the st@@ anza in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic courts ( fish stock market ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they will be displayed near the entrance Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ tur@@ u ( and &quot; Plastic Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; ) of each dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they are entering or going on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo District of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a large number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is now turned into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blogger Pan@@ ini published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new cell@@ phone straps decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin cooling cup@@ ones mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food deliveries is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an a@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as cell phone stands .
we also produced this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura and nit@@ r@@ ile roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands from dried salmon .
further sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes you can view at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow us on Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag # Priv@@ ul@@ ence Or@@ dering Form # Priv@@ ul@@ ence .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . such as the Sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic foods are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed persons appear regularly only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ning or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ende a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) to give a voice to these victims and stories of people who were ri@@ dden in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( german : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches every weekend secret tom@@ bs for his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew in just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 , he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment , it has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ende a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a scientist of Animal pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known disease and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for some years now .
I pass every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with images , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from professionals .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants him to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic .
the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; inc@@ ess@@ ant . &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not touched and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : like a family with threats pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in it she describes how armed criminals hit money from their business month for month until they destroyed their business in the end , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain on this never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in these terrible days I wonder@@ ed if tears would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence marked by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ tillas warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year .
however , they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody body of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looks like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence by organised crime and the struggle against it ming@@ led with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council for Public Safety and Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ das per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ende a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which it links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to susp@@ end a rum@@ or or expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something emerged the first time ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of me@@ tic@@ ulous coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate .
trag@@ ically , the tank car fell victim to it .
official representative described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses enc@@ ir@@ cled , including a cinema nearby , full of people watching the football world championship .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated for recognition .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident appear the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lying on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo has been typ@@ ed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o Go@@ won .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count dead bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dism@@ ember@@ ed , shot or burnt .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ clear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo came up again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ gi@@ vings ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal commentary such as this is fal@@ sely related to the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lighten@@ ing message , published by the United Nations describes those who could flee blows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts looked like the one who brought these descriptions with photos from DR Congo :
this picture was taken by an Saudi Arabian news page , fal@@ sely claimed by President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an Being , Mon@@ ks and politicians were involved in the murder of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was accessed last April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , have also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false dec@@ ou@@ pling date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
with the help of a revers@@ ed picture search , you can see how far information can cross borders .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images under 18,@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images that are very similar to the said image of DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private sites , social media platforms and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have defined examples of impro@@ per use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which page they have been published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which have also been linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the Orange Card ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of fake cou@@ pl@@ uses of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or false noti@@ fications .
the gray countries are examples that according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ y@@ Eye are likely to show counter@@ fei@@ ting examples too .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread about the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City will not only mention the Fal@@ se Report , but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( DR Congo and beyond ) .

this page used the image as a proof that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek Fak@@ ten@@ check page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a Association of the Stud@@ ents of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim by the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the old town of Pie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this message on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et expressing sympathy to the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pursued , to del@@ eg@@ i@@ timi@@ ze , as the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government has published a right to do what it considers as &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions about Myanmar . &quot;
this judge , which was published exclusively in English , includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech run and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news item wron@@ g@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted in 2012 that the monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story along with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , published now , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that this is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later went into circulation in connection with the massacre of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am from 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of DR Congo emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and on the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that were presum@@ ed in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages related there@@ to have not been taken into account in any religious context .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message which suppos@@ edly was written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the emb@@ assy in which the picture was taken from DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced himself .
there are further confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous usage of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the Gra@@ y portfolio ) , Tin@@ y@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ e- / dat@@ est@@ amps exist on the cra@@ wler and occasionally they have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original disaster of 2010 , the image may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of for@@ ci@@ ble images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of ref@@ using to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss in terms of for@@ ci@@ ble portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s message reporting .
technolog@@ ically , they are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which actually can also be used detached from the context or completely mis@@ used way .
any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all translate .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ met@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online @-@ list for quite a while .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ ape language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Wa@@ it around your parents in recognition of how to make your effort in your younger years .
words in H@@ uns@@ rik Language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that one feels after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Birds own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish even more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite destinations here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually ends in late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya come across the ri@@ verb@@ anks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge deposits .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
flood water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly mis@@ si@@ les wor@@ sen the crisis of Den@@ gue , warns of Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water level of Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the air force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are ready for transport of emergency deliveries for the inhabitants of their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Sri Lanka Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods to flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if animals in this area need help .
the tax@@ onom@@ u@@ f app Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the Cat@@ astrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched a &quot; SOS &quot; button which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka where several social media platforms are fully exploited bring people in need of safety and help aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now approaching the long path to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girl@@ friend .
I confi@@ de in her my four years old daughter ; she confi@@ det@@ h in me her children : she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next step , we are looking for rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the icon@@ ographic image of a woman with a head scarf , bound from an American flag , others cl@@ en@@ code slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
my girl@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; I ask .
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their conception .
they un@@ mus@@ li@@ mis@@ e me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in there , are un@@ c@@ ud@@ d@@ led .
to be un@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry by the day he died .
but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , just as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist paintings of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures are also prot@@ ru@@ ding today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to arrest them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ ra@@ tives dominate our news feeds .
this nar@@ ra@@ tively over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their lands in the last three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ ra@@ tives fail to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scarf in public buildings , Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong nar@@ ra@@ tives weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it can be seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought into slavery .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has cast our collective imagination such deep and fla@@ wed that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children become the goal of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and man@@ ik@@ an@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the nature we are telling them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion include
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ ra@@ tives that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry is failure to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here where there are seven million Muslims in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ based Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants from 77 countries .

approved use .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re @-@ invented the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were inevitable Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting rid of my Muslim recipes or my handy bag that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I &apos;m jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the nature in which we are telling them , there is Islam@@ opho@@ bia in more than just a stranger who tears the head scarf .
or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole United States , see below .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

approved use .
I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim first was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a pro@@ visional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following concepts : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim when it could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all @-@ ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter , if I saw her in my arms , and she whis@@ pered the Arab verses to the protection that seal the Kor@@ an and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

approved use .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; how decades ago they win a contest of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by its completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saint ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : God Me , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - over the centuries - have been colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire &quot; created by a company named Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging is to grow up and to hear that men are not crying , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in between , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an we@@ pt bitter@@ ly around his family in India dominated c@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot @-@ bom@@ be of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ missive of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he traveled to more parts of the world as I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim trunk of 1.7 billion goes deeply into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es , our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over each continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy takes the US and the susp@@ ects carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four@@ teen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was created by a liber@@ ated black slaves called Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple bin@@ dings , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble Dou@@ bt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people are establishing structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this second .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim regi@@ str@@ atures which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders against people from precisely the countries that bom@@ bard them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and bul@@ b@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely cap@@ tures Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we reject on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientifically wrong picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too dar@@ ing to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades behind to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous print@@ outs that we are ste@@ aling in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many ways .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sh@@ orter Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , more frequently to print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they are master@@ ing large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me an un@@ bound Muslims today .
things I left in my speech like a bread@@ cr@@ umb .
things that may spark your memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , conversations took place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam hos@@ tility .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell you about this at this T@@ ED@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people are being be@@ headed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , was even more scientific than Stan@@ ford for four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we did not give us a new future , while he already bombar@@ ded cap@@ ut@@ te countries and &quot; to other &quot; man @-@ made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it begins with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ rative Art seeks to preserve urban language diversity
story @-@ telling , by fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another Steven Bird initiative , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages in large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
while &quot; listening often is connected to understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listen to &quot; listening to , to feel , to touch . &quot;
in this format , histori@@ ans present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional history @-@ t@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their representation cause the audience to get involved .
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as if language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ u@@ ara tells the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ u@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his feeling of inclusi@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ stories .
Puerto Rico calls for US re@@ determination of sovereign debt
with the objective of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , on the last 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the Pu@@ ert@@ orium Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ uro @-@ examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of fixing the debt have also filed a petition on the official web site of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico are demanding that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are held responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconc@@ ile themselves with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the state alliance , is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without a party affili@@ ation with a focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extern@@ ally imposed measures will run away from the people without the participation and conviction of citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration bore the name of a night watch for light and truth .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian writer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture oriented in Berlin , an event organised by the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ quiry ( Cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book published last year and is freely available here is a set of ess@@ ays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built up and what the real cost is with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors working on the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ac@@ claimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of A@@ dra prison , in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information whatsoever about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court out of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technolog@@ ist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations and here merge gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sys@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el was not able to finish this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in jail :
I spent my whole life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a diary she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English .
the book is available licence @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; Es happens &quot; :
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace each other ,
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the comm@@ otion of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words .
which I carry with passion with me ,
if your eyes fail to say good
and I &apos;ll let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all these moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels History is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the use of force by the regime were tort@@ ured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International since 2011 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in custody since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : again on previous post due to corruption @-@ condemned Director after release
Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence , on which corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ end@@ ants because of mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public money from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released for good leadership in 2016 and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post as the firm did not conduct a disciplinary procedure after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action good .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the inf@@ rin@@ gement .
the company apparently kept silent , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also decl@@ ines this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had subsi@@ ded .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict harm .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is f@@ ond of being paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn &apos;t have any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za rewards the state because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already ins@@ ul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za l@@ acks to return to the state , and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only avail@@ ed itself on the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belonging to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Moz@@ ambi@@ que but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ted and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker .
one of his most famous verb@@ al represent@@ ations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling his own individual interest for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is also criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he dropped off for ten years and was free .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ors many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or cra@@ tic cra@@ cks .
photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted
according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network recorded their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East indi@@ an origin or generally used as ad@@ jec@@ tives &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or some of them ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call out Hass@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ mes@@ an is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ ade cra@@ cker ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet &apos;s opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before it sol@@ ves all the posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you &apos;re writing on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users social networks simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored Word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new Facebook Policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they would have only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , this would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken offline .
here you can see some scre@@ en@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is intended to hei@@ ghten violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ous hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , rather in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the inf@@ ant

the inf@@ ant is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious groups adher@@ ed to practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public scre@@ am . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ Persian ad Mahar@@ aj , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not rage . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
statistics of the UN for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and with 18 it were 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married among 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media moves that were trying to abol@@ ish laws for inf@@ ancy followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; child@@ birth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critics should be dam@@ ned even for their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this fact un@@ complicated , and at some point there was no doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law pro@@ claim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle re@@ posted to Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the inf@@ ant was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one was decided against it .
after it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws for child@@ birth had finally been changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member , Lov@@ ell Francis , who suffers from a minist@@ erial commission in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took too much time and unnecessary talk which has obsc@@ ured the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the inf@@ ant is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago and that is almost worth every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it took me long enough to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook of L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage law has been decre@@ ed .
minimum age - 18 , - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
follow @ Angel@@ we@@ be@@ di@@ tor Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marriage age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation of 18 years .
the draft on the change of the sp@@ ouses was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MPs who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inf@@ estation in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is no longer allowed .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ ru ag@@ ei@@ schil@@ dab@@ use .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps should the law be passed and he seems to rede@@ em his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject otherwise .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing so broad@@ ly , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , would simply talk about that the state , our daughters guar@@ ding against them , might be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in advantage of them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it &apos;s not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the inf@@ ant is legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

on Sunday morning , the Office of the Public Prosecutor announced Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mir@@ r@@ oring web pages Turkish users can view wi@@ ki@@ pedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dar@@ ker .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey has now blocking the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series resist the blocking .
although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third @-@ largest VPN premi@@ ums ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( calcul@@ ator computer ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship difficult .
the content is , in spite of the legal prohibition , ob@@ tain@@ able .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we have heard the news ( via Wikipedia ) , we have everything to place snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only scre@@ en@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the ban .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is blocked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reports Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices &apos;s member and staff at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ ak pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access another URL , which is not the original . that which you can see is by Wikipedia .
essentially , the server will guide the query to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a pleasant N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with badly positioned motives and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his home town right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ rate situation helps in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called to Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) . he had received a phone call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to take pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une in nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fri@@ ghtening as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already facing tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he sat down immediately , we see us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos .
his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une nature and wildlife is , however , not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , it dar@@ es Indian women for the first time to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am Gay@@ i in J@@ har@@ k@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid using the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women agree that due to the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a was condemned by a pseu@@ do @-@ court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had raised a married kin with her name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by the name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer jurisdiction to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ é in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main conversation topic in the city .
it is a place only for them , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s tre@@ ason to exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club .
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round was women who did not call their hus@@ bands on their names .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves .
not to speak lou@@ dly the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they perpet@@ u@@ ously uph@@ old and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving , and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a century @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she had gig@@ gl@@ ed only in front of him during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole annex@@ ed fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ bing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the woman in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as the carrying of the in@@ ox @-@ red point on the forehead , which shows the status of the married couple :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ Red point if he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few months they celebrated their birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years , yet I have never been so honest about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say some things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing .
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ war Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , wearing ; they have not dar@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes , the mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that the women could wear it .
next , they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they &apos;ll manage it .
asked whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are rolling slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of their husband .
some , including me , still make it , but only when they are alone and there are no other members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
women in the Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the h@@ ag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain raw materials :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a comm@@ em@@ oration day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
scre@@ enshot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on 29th June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend in the h@@ ash@@ tag , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered to be a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese go through .
people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! to date , the Beat@@ les Memorial Day is in Japan .
even today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les Memorial Day is celebrated .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places associated with the band .
when you love the Beat@@ les , these are the 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be sk@@ ur@@ ry enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les Memorial Day is celebrated .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
and of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market conditions , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will go today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are being ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be the target of attacks in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald men for organ traffi@@ cking , presum@@ ably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ton , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they believed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there was the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal or bring gold , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC reported .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in South Africa to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to combat super@@ sti@@ tions and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ que police after the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ton , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police are already following :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head have power to gener@@ alize the riches .
in the last days three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and express our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , took Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) to expand access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , his wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who themselves spend themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ sels &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future we are doing the honour of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the Open Web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we honor the efforts of all the people and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the start of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization .
inn@@ um@@ erable of those arrested or forced by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , such as the International Human Rights Organisation , Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dissi@@ dent , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced late June that he was hospit@@ alized due to the cancer of the liver in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department of China referred to Li@@ us Fall as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and nar@@ rated a nar@@ r@@ ator , he deemed it &quot; not necessary to discuss this affair with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or permit him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Li@@ u &apos;s case .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ um@@ ed until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume salmon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at in the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an Declaration on 30 June :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to abol@@ ish all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States
us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 the news agency AF@@ P to release the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the request of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada , Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us attorney first told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed Li@@ u to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , France
France &apos;s Foreign Office called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where . furthermore his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although France &apos;s news conference reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will finally record it .
Taiwan found on Taiwan
the Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on June 27 and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progres@@ sive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Li@@ u and stated that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished could have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city should be considered .
... nobody asked whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons presented by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore could not be measured with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic as they are better suited to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ replies .
he could answer appropriate questions with non @-@ replies of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear this point , provided that it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the criticism that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements should be better understood , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so relu@@ ct@@ ant even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities could win a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ ously commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a fool &apos;s spokesperson ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we are only considered independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return ?
Singapore is unique , it &apos;s equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city , but not their country ?
who must our Prime Minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink personal ID ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
as the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine expands to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t tell what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this pro@@ position seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country , above all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .

scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors exposed about certain parts of the world and to be shown a different fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series is written by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question most of me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I then answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered cour@@ te@@ ous to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature &quot; usually follows my clari@@ fication : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans maybe cook in anger when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t b@@ other me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag clearly visible to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always borne small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country facing ethnic groups .
we are not just like these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would replace me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically ir@@ relevant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has their own Canadian double @-@ han@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not to earn any attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice , &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence along the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ dio@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has published a music video that de@@ codes the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Tattoo Colour band describes a young man who tells the rules which dict@@ ates his girl@@ friend .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
only within the first three days the video loaded onto Facebook was 1,@@ 254 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 liv@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta .
take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has per@@ si@@ sted in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of the &quot; setting change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics .
the picture above mirrors the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors the online content and individuals who were accused of le@@ aking up the monarchy , prosec@@ uted .
Thailand sets strict protection against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the issues that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened by long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile the teas@@ er of the song showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute to Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch enemies during the protests in 2014 .

the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ ech@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ bey war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ ki@@ ava are in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ ck of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ ortation , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together on Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the majority of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic for cy@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been over 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ end@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have now abandoned the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Khr@@ us@@ h@@ che@@ v , which still house one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .

about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she is instead supporting her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation draws to an end , a little boy goes past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children is now watching the ball scre@@ aming .
as they run , some of them throw stones on the displac@@ ed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who cares about their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; is home to migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 and appears here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the names of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2,50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez says , the people come to the full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; mo@@ m Africa !
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also slept on cart@@ ons outside .
she does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys drugs that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family arrived from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move nor@@ th@@ wards .
the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic and Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his trip to the United States .
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
it is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to get money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single person , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travelers see their tel@@ eph@@ ones cal@@ m@@ ly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother , she has a lot of photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a female , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , as she briefly introduces them to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users to say ,
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of the town Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone message in which they had the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police said that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network remotely .
this app , with the filters for min@@ ors , is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China usually focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often som@@ bre for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ or@@ ship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ down@@ s .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published on Twitter , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen asked the residents to check if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use appliances that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China , &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which indicates that the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions given by the City Council to minim@@ ise the spread of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and institutions associated with the party , including universities and research institutes , are required to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on June 27 , in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities published a regulation with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1st their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; be registered at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos , but this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is van@@ ishing .
everything has gradually been resolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality re@@ stores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth moves on on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . you realize that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone set up stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service expressed it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five you@@ ths were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sh@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts demanded , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not have high demands on a city that is blocked up to the arter@@ ies with state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were alli@@ ed with a splendid picture that fully fulfilled my expectations .
at such a moment , you become aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return your voice after you scre@@ amed them all the way up to the Security Service desk .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I do now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in sol@@ itary and his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father was equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed pro@@ position lies in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a cor@@ ridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise , this time they have allocated a larger cell .
I have to share it with just one single prisoner and may immediately sit down without waiting for her permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I res@@ orted to an old proven communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he answered me ultimately .
apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there is no visible facial features to me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to disp@@ el all these cro@@ ws which are on the fruit in my head &apos;s garden .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 . Sh@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be li@@ stens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from fre@@ eing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect , thus they played their confes@@ sional black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view .
this is not a home that is not a land here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he appears to me .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ ets and to protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used to get used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to it or badly to be punished , even though I did not do anything to earn that punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confes@@ sion . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , probably from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er shall delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them alter@@ n@@ ated while I was still in line .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and found no favor at all , which is why he was coming next to an electri@@ cally charged staff .
electricity flo@@ wed all my body enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two horri@@ fic hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed that came to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fulfil@@ s the space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted young@@ ster : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you &apos;ll be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he lo@@ oses to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( like : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and questioned her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ental ide@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that from Damascus to Syria reach completely to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and he can feel according to his own statement with the people suffering from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t openly admit it , he h@@ ates a special a@@ version against U.S. foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he says himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured into water sol@@ uble Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ram@@ ad@@ an .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the bats speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the v@@ ests of the K@@ ent c@@ ig@@ ar in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you take a look at neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert statement .
the member and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had just been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also state that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous ac@@ tivis@@ m which in@@ jects the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continued to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simple rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflects an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b drew up traditional gender norms by shaping his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &apos; hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &apos; has been accepted in Jordan - the official outside of Jordan .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ours reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still striking that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law of anti @-@ crime legislation in 1954 , women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can &quot; be imprisoned for in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to happen .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music is also very popular and is well @-@ known to not shy away from subjects that remain as tab@@ u in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was d@@ anced with politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ ei@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians , and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b launched an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to mem@@ ori@@ ze later that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and advoc@@ ates that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ die , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who later should work on behalf of the cali@@ ph@@ es , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan don &apos;t ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service arrested several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they have cri@@ tically commented on comments in social media dealing with the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row but the way of progress - so it looks H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , stra@@ igh@@ ten@@ ing and arti@@ fici@@ ally created democra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ rior doll@@ s are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many parts of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , drums and dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , into the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two ball@@ ads are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend his summer :

external appearance and personal care were rare as in this story , as they help keep Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital city - a region with a very high crime rate where street smo@@ kers and illegal drugs traffi@@ cking are all @-@ day .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens enter the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these sophisticated hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
experts face each other in order to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks on how to see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
education institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Call@@ ao , have found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser &apos;s art instead of bad advice , which makes it possible for them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we built this educational community out of love with the children .
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the article entitled &quot; Lov@@ em@@ aking messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write letters of love to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel dis@@ advant@@ aged ?
this is exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the FAR@@ C gu@@ err@@ illa movement ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace .
Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who had lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rh@@ et@@ oric and were carrying weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now enter its ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who is to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to briefly speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we are writing thousands of letters of love to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people in the most urgent need this year .
thus the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FAR@@ C who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
to date , more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp in order to convey the letters personally .
the members of the FAR@@ C presented themselves as they had done before in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the student student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former war@@ rior led me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa war@@ ri@@ ors .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL gren@@ ade laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never before in my life someone wrote something like that , so I answer to it . &quot; suddenly , the tears ran over my che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him completely and placed me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this struggle , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else of life than war . to join the FAR@@ C was the only way to preserve it and its six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices , new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C joined a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already war and the FAR@@ C already acted in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the FAR@@ C declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice done on the part of the state on the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people , whom I often saw as monsters and even had learned hate , are only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the command@@ ant of the camp at Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian people were prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , to lift themselves up and to protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the FAR@@ C now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ bu@@ wa and its first publication on the website OC Media took place .
homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not been created overnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several months ago the LG@@ BT@@ Q legislation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines after reports have been published , discussing the dep@@ ortation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove that shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents passed the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still escape the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up at the hospital again .
apparently some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cur@@ ses were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my mascul@@ ine name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
for this I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim name , a k@@ au@@ c@@ astic name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
I got threats last February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called me , wrote me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that everything was just g@@ ossi@@ p , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother in the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster that is not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you &apos;re a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with a dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number@@ plate with a 95 .
after it happened the third time it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the number signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them , without regi@@ stering myself , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe me , you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you plug . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some traditional Caribbean elements still carry me in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat@@ ting with camera , I really try to figure out how the person looks at her from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I filed a report in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told us that during Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are gay men still held in these secrets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not so many people .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been abandoned by their relatives to stand up to Kad@@ y@@ rows .
as far as I know , they are recorded there , so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and say they have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared but specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their be@@ ard grew .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was in the process when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports about it yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else wouldn &apos;t it have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how is this possible under the law of sh@@ aria ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed las@@ hes , wore tu@@ b@@ je@@ ans and short tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never scrat@@ ched a hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : Khar@@ da@@ ma Khar@@ kov . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just shut their eyes ahead of you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never struck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ als on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed at once looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I returned home I could feel the situation in the republic was steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating .
OC Media : what activity do you now go to ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ ac@@ re@@ ff , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food tickets .
I don &apos;t have a cent for that .
I discovered these people themselves when I picked up the places of refuge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am Muslims and want to help those who need help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ off ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
it is nature that has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ye who want to keep you with foam before the mouth that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ an have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ins have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ ent to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
for the past few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : usage with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he felt ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the in@@ ability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video that was shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani @-@ Hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on site warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all the fathers of the family who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , based on a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa community living in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livel@@ i@@ hoods .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields currently occurring in Iran , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically ref@@ uses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also has built a large number of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only resulted in deteri@@ or@@ ating devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k youth rose to 81 % now .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Collabor@@ ative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , finished the primary school 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ mad men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ hi@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging from Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ i@@ hood outside their home Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be hired , as even Arabic names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi had to endure , human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world awak@@ ens and takes knowledge of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoi@@ dable .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als not &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even think well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ists * in general .
for example , nowadays , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , black c@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and out of femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists have left silent .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to mention that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or above , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ ti@@ ces in her thinking , which refer to both the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a horri@@ ble and margin@@ alized being in historical terms .
I refuse to join groups that , moreover , absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . some of them will continue to dis@@ close the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join me with the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that Inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ari@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ Wom@@ an@@ ismus : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
fighting against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq , a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq , who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persec@@ uted , little respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed municipalities that can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays &apos; women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by structural components . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ servo Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of mal@@ treatment , the ac@@ ten@@ acious view of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez used nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women give an indication at all , they generally do not receive any support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must report at all with the law enforcement authorities .
cont@@ ent@@ s@@ 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not forbi@@ d 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation hits and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different reports and reports that do not even approach the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; she explains .
the numbers available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office reached 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the police were reported by women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peac@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers . here too , 86 % of women &apos;s advertis@@ ements came .
in the advertis@@ ements , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Minister of Women , Ana Bai@@ ardi will show only a few of these crimes . &quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman compens@@ ated for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said she at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone journalists included at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay , a woman died due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should always rep@@ ent her .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she carried out psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I never thought that I would be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ missive , because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told them how he had isolated them .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had dropped out of Carlos for so long and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment would at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment in any way .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she took a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her native country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed at the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known as the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non@@ invasive ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to declare Fem@@ izi@@ d on an independent criminal record and to pun@@ ish those who are already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legal text has been changed in some ways in order to win delegates to the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions will be lev@@ elled , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison .
the original draft bill had en@@ vis@@ aged the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence currently have to carry , if they just want to permit and maintain a secure housing , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ thinking must take place here , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he who is silent in the face of these facts complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the execution of the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to refund for such a long time until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed , among other things , a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back .
this article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by structural components . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ servo Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
independent media in Oman one year after the ban on a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Indian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having dism@@ issed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , to restrict public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to in@@ timi@@ date and det@@ ain .
the authorities viol@@ ate peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens from expressing their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment for three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its founding in 2007 , corruption was reported in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor in chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties bind hands of justice &quot; in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 . in this it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the Board of Directors , was invited to the Special Department from the ISS and arrested upon his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS res@@ um@@ ed Deputy Chief Editor You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information admitted the statement that &quot; the publication and circulation of the newspaper on any road , including online , will be banned from August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held before the Court of Mas@@ quer@@ ade in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms , and ordered the newspaper &apos;s final closure .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for a distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ ania ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 U.S. dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ an Ri@@ al ( 13,@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pris@@ on in Mask@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the court &apos;s decision to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the App@@ eals Court to re@@ press the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the continued shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ain@@ ment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Indian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf centre for human rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Mexican authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial kill@@ ings .
the Gulf centre for human rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( even independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in ad@@ joining states by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : firstly , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare system that cover specific medical needs on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research , carried out by African scientists , helps build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Research on Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also launching a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
Q : what do you think is the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipi@@ ents instead of being makers themselves .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : USA and Europe .
the projects are well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the more difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system that magazines can only make items accessible to pay ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how open source seed producers change global food production
this paper by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding Sal@@ ad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NA@@ SA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn &apos;t use it for breeding .
the patents pose not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cardboard varieties . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer , since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if there is a bou@@ lder in a river that I have to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand firm to court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the USA and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the ISS international space station ISS have bred and ate red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ geous in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the move from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the open source seed initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted software .
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant bre@@ eders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others who buy their seeds to breed it so as to breed their own varieties , and not to sow them immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
more ble@@ ak prospects
Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg take control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds also play a role in larger contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the open @-@ source movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; he says and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is , for example , on farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is therefore always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all anti@@ trust characters are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant bre@@ eders to be used either at all or only ag@@ grav@@ ated .
such estim@@ ations are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat can be patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a Ques@@ tion of Visi@@ ble
plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desired tra@@ its - from those through which their taste or colour improves until such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics suggest that the available plant material for bre@@ eders takes more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four co @-@ banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradi@@ cts that intellectual property protects other bre@@ eders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties encourage innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
such protection doesn &apos;t inhi@@ bit innovations , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : for 20 years to wait until a patent is running , there are certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait long for breeding plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it remains to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to ease their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and the latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the whole , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the U.S. state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation are mainly used her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , grow into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) have patents , they create the most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
Mort@@ on believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative because of avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that have patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
while the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , carries out an open source seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional farm varieties , the centre with farmers works together and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ ements is working on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ SS@@ I commitment cannot simply be taken over by one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows for patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
a statement , however , is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the &quot; open source seed &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official launch .
a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group for erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have rarely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around 5th August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ NU@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who are supposed to defend the law , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ NU@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to yield . we ins@@ ist on further fulfilling our task .
AN@@ NU@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , for example the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arabic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web page locks fell victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ TH@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researchers Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the Egyptian government &apos;s app@@ liance is the goal of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Blogger , the provider who is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , is on the other hand more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting on the student protests and recorded a video of how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s blocking and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey the feeling of a state of si@@ ege , an arrest , an attempted murder , an un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blo@@ gging blo@@ gs as well as any other website I worked for .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post items to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courage@@ ous are going the way until the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August 133 Websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone , and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
moreover , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers by transferring internet cens@@ or@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web sites that V@@ PN@@ s started .
such practices indicate the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users might have access to .
in addition , the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ or@@ ship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed in court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers across Brazil are reporting glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the country &apos;s second largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , navy and air w@@ af@@ ts to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio for detailed reporting on Viol@@ ence in Rio published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes on :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to obsc@@ ure the atro@@ cities of the police that only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira re@@ ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; ar@@ gues . this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account responsibility for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
reminder : the Federal State of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is greater than its capital .

calling Rio de Jan@@ eiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the murder rates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , has recently reiter@@ ated the security policy of the state for years .
these security policy measures also included the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit that was set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police order and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease in for@@ ci@@ ble deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ anes and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor municipalities that should protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux c@@ ited from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to deplo@@ y means and means that are typical of a war . this involves entering the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an obsc@@ ure point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; blin@@ ded spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is now a week that the police arrive at the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
amid all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : revi@@ ved Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ ge
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to vic@@ tories Watch , a joint initiative of the Syria peace organization PA@@ X and the Syria Institute &apos;s research institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently are about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege .
the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is particularly affected , where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these areas have been besieg@@ ed by rebel controlled areas outside Damascus , leading to the fact that residents are dependent on local food or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ re@@ achable for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian assist@@ ants and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food products planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the project Direc@@ torate , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said AF@@ P to the French news agency :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultiv@@ ating mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more known . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the Human@@ it@@ arian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 family knowledge of planting mushrooms , thus Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , September 4th , 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced fuel is made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; production of mushroom seeds from the regions , &quot; before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms all over East G@@ hou@@ ta for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of 2017 fires
on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many regional capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for victims of fires ra@@ mp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of forest fires between 15 and 16 October .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ ic@@ ia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which over@@ sees the forest surfaces per satellite , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there are only in four districts no fire .

numerous videos are spread across the web and show images that allow better insight into what is happening :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the woods of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
in addition , building approvals in locations with high risk of fire are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought to grave fires in 2003 and 2005 , was critici@@ zed by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had the means for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val also continued in the same article of the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper .
the environmental organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to fires of this species .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants looked for information or tried to contact their relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it took advantage of their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire brig@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

the way from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the T@@ ali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan last time with his family during dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never any more .
in the morning , the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the T@@ ali@@ ban and many ha@@ i@@ ara felt protected .
the T@@ ali@@ ban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
he worked in a coal mine for a few years . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged s@@ acks with mortar which were he@@ avier than himself in order to earn his livel@@ i@@ hood .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we mounted nylon in front of the open windows , so that we could not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago , A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high twin rati@@ os . it is also true that the conditions that apply to asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this involves impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after regi@@ stering the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either reli@@ ant on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ conditional way of living helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of construction work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ per put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food stop .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant on the Orient , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail trade and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a Kab@@ ul factory in which people can learn packaging and preserv@@ atives . &quot; so they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ate &apos;s Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , vic@@ tories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft law that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users would have to be able to use social networks within six months of a successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name as well as their ID number .
anyone who fails to take this step may be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the prosecution of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was applied by 60 Members of Parliament , is currently prec@@ eded by the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May another member of the Parliament filed a bill that would be harder for ins@@ ul@@ ting the president or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Egypt &apos;s right to ins@@ ult the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . under the legislative proposal , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan , like more than 700 prot@@ esters , who had been arrested at the same incident , waited four years in prison for a court date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed until the 20th May , because the prison administration has failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ant to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including the flo@@ od@@ light of weapons of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in Giza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ isian activ@@ ist on le@@ aked documents inter@@ rog@@ ated
in May , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly questioned by a le@@ aked action plan . the plan explicitly comes from the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft law , which would ensure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused officers of am@@ ne@@ sty .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at thro@@ ws a light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources stating Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian Press Code , which guarantees journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on the 09@@ th of May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their identification ?
according to new provisions of the information bure@@ au of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media .
in the rules , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
anal@@ ysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments to be reached within social networks . it is not clear until now how authorities apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these rules only sel@@ ectively to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state cens@@ or@@ ship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; organiz@@ er of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make the said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ n@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the indications that Turkey supports the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site had been blocked because it was &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to raise a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop s@@ no@@ oping down
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation on elevated surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted t@@ elec@@ oms companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population out@@ war@@ dly .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of the Interior .
