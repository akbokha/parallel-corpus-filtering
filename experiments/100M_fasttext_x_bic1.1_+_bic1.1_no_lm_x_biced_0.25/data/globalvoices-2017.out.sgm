<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I mainly became a journalist because of an American movie.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnates with the help of Julia Roberts as a law student.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "free to Method Man," "" "" "" "I was as if that's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackened letter of love about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never holds behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican election was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominated candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from all over the world, a deep-believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumpet's Weltanschauung also agreed not to the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer, Peter Bhatia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Dumps Intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who struggles for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump paved his way to nominee Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and implies an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those electors, most of whom are white, voted for a trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (note of the Ü): as much as "revolt against all other ethnicities"; pun white in allusion to white and whiplash, what the big Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trumpet, however, a huge portion of the white America gives up this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd replied with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "no!" "" "" "" "they called and their voices were louder." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if anyone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a unanimous and vociferous" "" "" "" "NO" "" "" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumpingland, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The Recycled Instruments Orchestra "by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large landfill site, just 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial town that is popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (musical band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and the gangs of violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with gleaming eyes and playing in the hustle they learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers began to turn parts of the waste into instruments under direction of Favio Chavez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophone, trumpets, trombones and percussion all made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in rubbish. the children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from litter.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "a documentary called" "" "" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "" "" "(Harmonic waste dump) shows the musical performance:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill harmony follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">As part of an agreement with Global Voices, re-release takes place for shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly angered and little inclined to welcome a law-breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were swiftly mobilizing themselves against the ship.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "" "" "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority, is a member of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia due to the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together." "" "" "" "they exchange information and stand each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are now in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news of suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attends the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious driving routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship carries its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such investigations may show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer financially worthwhile." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishermen entering into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, such practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, giving of phantasy seeds, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they specifically exploit the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted organized control system," "" "" "" "says Long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front functions.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its co-operation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect the illegal ships that are happy to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "" "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers technical support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, which can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">For this reason, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is supposed to help FISH-i find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Worldwatch platform with Google and the marine protection organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of every single trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"join with the neighbours to get a better picture of who does what's doing - that simply makes sense," he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and consolidate their resources into the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run where a global system permits the persecution of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously confiscated without license and hardly had to reckon with consequences know now that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in the FISH-i have meanwhile reported a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found there tug nets on board, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">Other countries also notice these successes. "the effect is so strong that other countries are now also copying," says Kiilu. "" we have become an object of study. "" in West Africa, several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="148">There have been six countries united in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fisheries, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With safety the goal is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia could report its first major triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship under a false flag. and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used towing networks that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also invaded into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "" by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing, "says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This image by María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country were running into the void while meeting on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example, the reindegeneration of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the centrally located district of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the Federal State of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which makes itself noticeable in the daily life of the Venetians by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro; however, the reluctance of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors of Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision in her latest article:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the rate of inflation is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Diamrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called on the demonstrators to join the National Assembly on 27 October, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan Government, was scheduled to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is time for Venezuela: tomorrow's National Assembly, Friday national civil strike and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures which tell about arguments, as well as reports of repression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear skirts because otherwise you could see something that many national gardists did not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round, which forms the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an impeachment procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people in the street.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs added:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado claim that 1% of the signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your removal!</seg>

<seg id="189">Others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little action against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to keep critical voices silent:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testified against his father in the large La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial that ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were examined.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magician.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, the torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a civil servant. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was in prison La Perla from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archival recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 counts and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who over the years realized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the base of the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone named him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You're an asshole, you've been friends with an ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Just make sure that she won't be kidnapped one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go back to the gymnasium. a few days later he took me to work on the base of the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base, I had to destroy documents belonging to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="229">The prisoners are tortured</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time, he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it I saw that there was a big lump of silver inside it.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen items were put down and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sped in and saw a couch that was tortured by man.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they put on the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person, which was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They seldom bind a man with handcuffs to the bed, overcast him with water, and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room.</seg>

<seg id="331">43 oppressors were found guilty of crimes against humanity. in 28 cases, the Court suspended sentences of life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years. in six cases, there were acquittals.</seg>
<seg id="332">Eleven of 54 defendants died during the trial.</seg>

<seg id="346">Edit the original photo of Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese town of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving licences, witnessed a particularly unsuccessful translation in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On one of the labels, the Japanese word "(koreisugsha), which means" older motorists, "was wrongly - perhaps also with malicious hullaby & # 8212; translated as" awful motorists. "</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from September 1 to 20 on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photo of Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also who made the local newspapers aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, appearing in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could such a translation come from?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">This is an insult to elderly people and in an international city as Kyoto simply unacceptable, "Holmes said.</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically not quite correct designation "elder drivers" (german: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake was already included in the text that they had received from the translator, and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger informed as follows about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we sincerely apologize that elderly people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation)," "" "" "" "the police said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News took a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "awful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved nationally in accidents, but is quite an occasion to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 seniors were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">As a result, their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the share of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The particularly unnamed reporter brought comments on the light published on Yahoo in the article published on Yahoo, showing what prejudices some Japanese apparently are against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo across the translation error received, among other things, the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">- "Is this (" awful motorists ") not the reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "" "" "-" "" "" "" "So miserably the translation is not at all, isn't it?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread circulation of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translation, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge, to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active rule of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally speaking, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate the English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost jumps or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who do not have foreign employees can nevertheless make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-User Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and puzzling sentences which are produced by machine translation show that this technology cannot replace human translators for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the weirdest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-User Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censorship actions on the Internet and TV take</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPY (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they would not have access to the online Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups opposing Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April after the Supreme Court resolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author of Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was known and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelan people with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is surprising that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible through a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online transmitters. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server will answer requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server will reply faulty or refuse the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third-locked channel, was suspended on Thursday 6 April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas, was put into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on air again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multi-media coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="414">Today, Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testimonies from other Crimean people who have been victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Voices, courtesy of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, escuelas que caen" ("Flying Cows, falling schools") edited by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she said." "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a criadita for the family. as a criadita, in Paraguay there are more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work in order to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers her underage son or her minor daughter to another more wealthy family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over her head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children must spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay as a result of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researching and denouncing.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by the name, as the feeling of gratitude that crippled the Crimean is generally not to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and can "make something out" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies his exploitation by believing that they give someone a chance that would otherwise not get education and maybe even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will only experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the borrowing in paraguayischen households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent strokes. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was in the household of the former military hospital Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira continued with a stick to Marín until she suffered a fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the Paraguayan society blackled practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest and demanded that there would be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," "" "" "" "said Tina Alvarenga." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín may be indicative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Jobbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all the way and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>

<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción in Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she was still time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned up the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she was finished with learning, the more leisure she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>

<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 until 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings, the landlord Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a criadite.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to me home. I didn't have a circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register with their correct names and ID numbers on the site, in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a cash buck.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, composed of six paragraphs and curated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video news and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are able to impose the registration. it is not clear how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyadr Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around facebook. because of this, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity in order to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not yet known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "leading research technologist") of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian Initiative für Personal Rights"), said Global Voices:</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine dealing with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activists Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, who roam through Africa and Asia are among the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). overall, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">How Raza shows in the video, "is the Persian Leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish Ecosystem," and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem is also dependent on a large predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">When the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist Raza passionately likes to show a different side of her country, which is not only made up of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">The IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group has been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for North East Japan, documented the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "three-fold disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was an etly prefecture in Japan's Northeast, experiencing both the earthquake and tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima prefecture saw a nuclear accident, even so, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows what progress has been achieved six years after the local point of view to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both the statistics of the Japanese Re-building Authority and the survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (for the constructs of some, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate Prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of Behel-houses (to the old, kasetsu juutaku) was to be relocated to final substitute houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such houses.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of evacuated people who were hauled after disaster in temporary homes were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by disaster, reopened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 per cent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have suffered large areas in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the farm land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima, are located in the "nuclear locking zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only be 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal dwellers find it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. it asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their perception has changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that there has still not been enough in disasters prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also stepped up its attention to the location of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been relocated to permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuates that still live in Behel-shelters are older than 50 years old. they are well-known because the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that one connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, broaden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode from Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we discuss issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="593">Left: the attack against Mateus Ferreira da Silva. photo: Luiz da Luz. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widely used photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was handed over to the intensive care unit this week. last Friday, a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Goiânia with a stick against his head. nationwide millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him on Saturday and moved him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the police officer's face can also be seen, which attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state Goiás announced that Sampaio was suspended from active ministry until the examination of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Goiânia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a media activist from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics are rushing to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from another perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below, you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus who lives in another federal state, Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="611">By: Heitor Vilela. publication with permission.</seg>
<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls on further violence against activists in Goiás:</seg>
<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilherme Irish has been murdered by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group had been sabotaged by a gas leak. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a policeman who hit him with a stick in his face.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police Handles</seg>
<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only state in Brazil where there was brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers used rubber floors and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had built a stage for speakers.</seg>
<seg id="617">The member of Flavio Serafini, a social and peace party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again Brazilian media has covered street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to decorate their front pages with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a brand-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be acknowledged if you are strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" is an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police is covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Cuba's Unforging villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Álvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular church Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no matter what there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After drowning, the sugar cane industry was still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities, until only the frame of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Around 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier-veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country to worry a few decades ago, but the bad harvest is no longer a new one.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they were hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">However, the sugar rate rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "agricultural perspectives" issued by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agrarian and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar export would generate approximately $85 million for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "" "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane plants, over 65 million people, received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats the most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents, which were distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Elise Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane plants that were still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, waits for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was against his will at the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it by means of hip-hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then partnered with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop begins with the fact that the young participants learn topics like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the strain of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called' Highway of tears', a road section in West Canada where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unexplained.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, although the youths did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a verse in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take away our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic courts in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they will be displayed near the entrance Shokuhin santuru (and "Plastic Models of the Courts") of each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they are entering or going on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo District of Kappabashi there are a large number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is now turned into striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger Panini published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the Shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new cellphone straps decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin cooling cupones magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food deliveries is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an aisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as cell phone stands.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura and nitrile roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with laughter?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appetizing form, for example, to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands from dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further scurrile plastic dishes you can view at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow us on Twitter hashtag # Privulence Ordering Form # Privulence.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry. such as the Shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed persons appear regularly only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourning or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone discovery in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal animal político has launched the digital project "Aprende a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking") to give a voice to these victims and stories of people who were ridden in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (german: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches every weekend secret tombs for his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her husband and two of her nephew in just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "" "" "priests:" "" "" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we loved." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="772">"" "" "" "where should we get them?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprende a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a scientist of Animal político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensational journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with images, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from professionals.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants him to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he's big. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were "incessant."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not touched and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the capital district: like a family with threats plundered." in it she describes how armed criminals hit money from their business month for month until they destroyed their business in the end, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain on this never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want the others to be arrested, because they don't know when they will kidnap or kill you." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I wondered if tears would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "" "" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence marked by violence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells him to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year.</seg>
<seg id="805">However, they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody body of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence by organised crime and the struggle against it mingled with the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council for Public Safety and Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office counted 3103 murders. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mordas per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprende a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to suspend a rumor or expose a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something emerged the first time? content in social media, no matter if true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial publication, it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of meticulous coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country was neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Official representative described a fireball, the dozens of houses encircled, including a cinema nearby, full of people watching the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated for recognition.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the incident appear the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lying on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been typed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "no one stayed behind to count dead bodies," "" "" "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burnt.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo came up again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, the misuse of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of misgivings; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal commentary such as this is falsely related to the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly prosecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightening message, published by the United Nations describes those who could flee blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts looked like the one who brought these descriptions with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture was taken by an Saudi Arabian news page, falsely claimed by President Myanmar's Than Being, Monks and politicians were involved in the murder of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was accessed last April 26, 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations, who called AFP as their source, have also falsely attributed to Thein being this statement, but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of this false decoupling date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With the help of a reversed picture search, you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 images under 18,8 billion pictures (as of May 3, 2017) 344 images that are very similar to the said image of DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mix of private sites, social media platforms and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages, such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="865">We have defined examples of improper use and associated them with the respective countries, on the basis of which page they have been published. thus, we want to represent the reach more clearly than through the language alone.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence related to the murders of Christians by Muslims or for the defense of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of forcible images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of refusing to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images sensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss in terms of forcible portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's message reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologically, they are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which actually can also be used detached from the context or completely misused way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. unreplaceable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremeta).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are needed to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online-list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwotape language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Wait around your parents in recognition of how to make your effort in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in Hunsrik Language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "kwadi" "" "" "" "- convenience or laziness that one feels after being warmed in the sun on cold days." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish even more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flooding and landslide disaster in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually ends in late May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya come across the riverbanks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">After an opinion of the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and sludge deposits.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls left on Saturday (May 27) and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flood water in Tawalama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka tweet provide regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly missiles worsen the crisis of Dengue, warns of Save the Children after further rainfalls are already on their way.</seg>
<seg id="980">This morning, the Neluwa Bus stood in the flood, water level up to 6 meters. Moragoda village near Galle also flooded due to the water level of Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The air force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are ready for transport of emergency deliveries for the inhabitants of their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups are also ready to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Sri Lanka Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid.</seg>

<seg id="989">Last year after the Catastrophe of the tropical storm Roanu, Pickme introduced a "flood aid" button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations. these were then forwarded to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched a "SOS" button which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flooding and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka where several social media platforms are fully exploited bring people in need of safety and help aid measures.</seg>

<seg id="1000">We are in a sea of umbrellas and people, some hold the iconographic image of a woman with a head scarf, bound from an American flag, others clencode slogans against Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1001">My girlfriend looks at me and says: "these things don't concern you, isn't it?" "why, because I am not Muslim?" I ask.</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar that they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that has built up in their conception.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They unmuslimise me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims, as I do not fit in there, are uncuddled.</seg>

<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry by the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western conception, the religion of Rumis was deleted, just as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deletion makes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>

<seg id="1025">I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, flawed narratives dominate our news feeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narratively overshadowed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their lands in the last three decades, while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narratives fail to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their headscarf in public buildings, Saudi-Arab, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both of which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exercises its "control" on the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narratives weakens Muslim women who lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It can be seen that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who had been brought into slavery.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has cast our collective imagination such deep and flawed that often Sikh-men and children become the goal of anti-Muslim attacks and manikanings.</seg>

<seg id="1118">And this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1119">There is one reason that conspiracy theorists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1120">They have grown exponentially, because they have made Muslims "others."</seg>
<seg id="1121">There is another group that has grown exponentially by creating the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1122">A few years earlier, it had not yet existed; now they are mastering large areas in Syria and Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter, but who made me an unbound Muslims today.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I left in my speech like a breadcrumb.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things that may spark your memories, as in all the intersections that make up our humanity, a story may lurk where someone is made to a "other."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley, conversations took place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam hostility.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than a hundred academics talk about our problems with "other," "structural racism" and "American militarism."</seg>
<seg id="1128">But these are not concepts that we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell you about this at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people are being beheaded by creating the "other" in public performance, was even more scientific than Stanford for four decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it, consciously and unconsciously to consolidate the "other"; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we did not give us a new future, while he already bombarded caputte countries and "to other" man-made "people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1133">It begins with all of us.</seg>
<seg id="1134">Initiative for Narrative Art seeks to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story-telling, by flickr-user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another Steven Bird initiative, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages in large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening often is connected to understanding" these events instead "listen to" listening to, to feel, to touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, historians present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional history-teller, their devotion and their representation cause the audience to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamuara tells the fable of the rabbit and the baboon in the language of Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "" "" "after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamuara is asked:" "" "" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "" "" "he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. anyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story-stories.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for US redetermination of sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the objective of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, on the last 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the Puertorium Capitol, the capital building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civic front for the neuro-examination of debt) and the ecumenical church meeting of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the advocates of fixing the debt have also filed a petition on the official web site of the White House of the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favor of the economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico are refusing to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We require immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not integrated into the state alliance, is suffering from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence, the so-called "Center for New Economy," an independent non-profit organization without a party affiliation with a focus on socioeconomic development, proposes a law for state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state view.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian writer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he has done for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture oriented in Berlin, an event organised by the # FreeBel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher of the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (Cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is freely available here is a set of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge will be built up and what the real cost is with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors working on the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of Adra prison, in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information whatsoever about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court out of his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more predictive than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merge greek-Roman architecture-types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything on this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was not able to finish this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am overwhelmed when I call his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a diary she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic to English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available licence-free.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: again on previous post due to corruption-condemned Director after release</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case, where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence, on which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants because of misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public money from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released for good leadership in 2016 and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to his old post as the firm did not conduct a disciplinary procedure after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP) condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary action against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent, however, and caused no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also declines this behavior and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had subsided.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is fond of being paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil says that the director doesn't have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza rewards the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks to return to the state, and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only availed itself on the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belonging to Samora Machel prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mozambique but also as a sharp, intersected and - by the way - prophetic speaker.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous verbal representations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man is capable of selling his own individual interest for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes the tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "" "" "an ambitious man is also criminal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also negative:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censors many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpea or cratic cracks.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network recorded their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East indian origin or generally used as adjectives "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censors the word "Kalar," or some of them (in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Kalar" may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call out Hassan "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubts about their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmesan is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spade cracker), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet's opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before it solves all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you're writing on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users social networks simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of censored Word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new Facebook Policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to read, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook Community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring only more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "" "" "it also seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words like" "" "" "" "Chair" "" "" "" "or" Erbsencurry "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they would have only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, this would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken offline.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain any hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the Burmese text reads" "" "" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kalar." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "" "" "the post says" "" "" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is intended to heighten violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to control the proliferous hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better, rather in context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law to ban this practice, so that the marriage-capable age is now 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious groups adhered to practice, and in May 2016 there was a great public scream. at that time, Brother HarryPersian ad Maharaj, a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age does not rage. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors as, "every man under the age of 18."</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for 2002-2012 show that the share of children who had been married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago amounted to 2.8 percent, and with 18 it were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married among 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media moves that were trying to abolish laws for infancy followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying" "" "" "" "childbirth" "" "" "" "critics should be damned even for their own affairs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this fact uncomplicated, and at some point there was no doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law proclaim." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle reposted to Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the infant was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and no one was decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for childbirth had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"" "" "" "Facebook member, Lovell Francis, who suffers from a ministerial commission in the Ministry of Education, said:" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk which has obscured the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the infant is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and that is almost worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought it took me long enough to complete the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook of Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage law has been decreed.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Follow @ Angelwebeditor Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the change of the spouses was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all MPs who were against have voted for the law." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1370">The infestation in Trinidad and Tobago is no longer allowed.</seg>

<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps should the law be passed and he seems to redeem his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a advocate of the law, said that it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wanted to address the debate on the subject otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing so broadly, instead of talking about the problem that we, instead of talking about the problem, would simply talk about that the state, our daughters guarding against them, might be abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in advantage of them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it's not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the infant is legal or still the norm in different gradations, although there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages Turkish users can view wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darker.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey has now blocking the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technically experienced Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third-largest VPN premiums), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 after the internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (calculator computer), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, in spite of the legal prohibition, obtainable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (via Wikipedia), we have everything to place snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the ban.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is blocked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reports Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices's member and staff at the Panigrahi's Open Speak podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL, which is not the original. that which you can see is by Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server will guide the query to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A pleasant Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-rate situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called to Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida lodge). he had received a phone call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to take pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune in nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already facing tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the bush appeared. he sat down immediately, we see us and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Neptune nature and wildlife is, however, not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid using the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women agree that due to the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state Odisha was condemned by a pseudo-court and rejected by her family and the village community after she had raised a married kin with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by the name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer jurisdiction to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walé in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main conversation topic in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children's treason to exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion round was women who did not call their husbands on their names.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to speak loudly the name of their husbands is a custom that they perpetuously uphold and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "" "" "then she asked all," "" "" "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a century-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she had giggled only in front of him during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole annexed frustration against him and his family by curbing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a lot of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the woman in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said," "" "" "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as the carrying of the inox-red point on the forehead, which shows the status of the married couple:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberRed point if he did." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the past few months they celebrated their birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years, yet I have never been so honest about some things, for example how our identities are tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say some things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted a Salwar Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, wearing; they have not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes, the morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to take a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they'll manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Asked whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are rolling slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still make it, but only when they are alone and there are no other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain raw materials:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the official Beatles YouTube channel.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On 29th June this year, the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend in the hashtag, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered to be a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to make the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! to date, the Beatles Memorial Day is in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today Beatles Memorial Day is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the familiar places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">When you love the Beatles, these are the 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be skurry enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today Beatles Memorial Day is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year as well.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan base in terms of market conditions, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald men for organ trafficking, presumably for superstitious purposes, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milton, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they believed that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There was the local superstition that the head of a bald man could reveal or bring gold, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC reported.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 carried out a mission in South Africa to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in Tanzania, where the government has developed campaigns to combat superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the town of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks, warned the Mozambique police after the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milton, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique said that the local police are already following:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head have power to generalize the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days three men were killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of the blog gers poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MIGHT A MOSABIK THAT YOU HAVE ashamed A country where people would have shame to call on the street as if they would be ashamed of the recordings of a pornofilm in which the teachers would be ashamed to take sex against good marks, and to hunt sex against good marks, a land in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for superstitious purposes or "black magic" are hunted that aim to attain fast riches.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some missed the opportunity for macabre humour.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users, tweetete that both the chief of the district Morrumbala, Pedro Sapange, and the police spokesman Zambézias, Inácio Dina, are both members of the country:</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: citizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) Neun Responses to the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and Dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced late June that he was hospitalized due to the cancer of the liver in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state threat) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department of China referred to Lius Fall as "an internal matter" and narrated a narrator, he deemed it "not necessary to discuss this affair with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or permit him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations, United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss Liu's case.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat in the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius, as stated in an Declaration on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the same time, we expect China to abolish all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans "wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad, in so far as he can help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 the news agency AFP to release the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The request of the US embassy drew a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, which they claim according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on July 7th and 8th at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada, Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum urged China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius attorney first told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed Liu to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression and freedom of expression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Office called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where. furthermore his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although France's news conference reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will finally record it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan found on Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Liu on June 27 and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu and stated that many asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished could have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the International branch of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "" "" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "" "" "twist the logic" "" "" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons presented by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which the political system of Singapore could not be measured with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic as they are better suited to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He could answer appropriate questions with non-replies of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point, provided that it was paid high in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the criticism that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that the context of Shanmugam's statements should be better understood, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore was more of a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so reluctant even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities could win a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "" "" "no country," "" "" "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "" "" "did Mr Shanmugam" "" "" "" "duously commit a mistake" "" "" "" "or was it a fool's spokesperson?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are only considered independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore return?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it's equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: to be called "nice," basically means to be idle - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically irrelevant figure of Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has their own Canadian double-hanger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not to earn any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadian.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band famous in Thailand has published a music video that decodes the Junta, which took power in 2014 and, despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Tattoo Colour band describes a young man who tells the rules which dictates his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Only within the first three days the video loaded onto Facebook was 1,254 times divided and received 8,800 livkes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persisted in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "" "" "may relate to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision on important national issues." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of the "setting change" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are viewed by the Junta as critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above mirrors the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army which monitors the online content and individuals who were accused of leaking up the monarchy, prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets strict protection against "Lese Majeste" (majesty).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the issues that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened by long sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the song showed members of the band, who imitated the Salut from "The Tribute to Panem," which was already used by putsch enemies during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society is recovering very slowly in East-East Asia, especially in the district of Tkuechal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now been over 20 years since the Georgian-abbey war officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharkiava are in the Kohlenbeck of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups, such as Russians, Greeks, Deportation, Georgians and Armenians, lived and worked together on Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the majority of Russians and chases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for cyarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been over 16,000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1819">The empty five-story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early '60s, called the chuschchkovkas, symbolize the decline and devastation of the region.</seg>
<seg id="1820">The buildings are falling and very rarely, they are inhabited by more than two families.</seg>

<seg id="1823">At the entrance of Dzhantukha village I met a native elderly man.</seg>

<seg id="1828">Before the war, the village was full of life.</seg>
<seg id="1829">There were community centres, schools and kindergartens that served all of the community.</seg>
<seg id="1830">Now there is only paved road with faded splendor buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1831">The people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union have now abandoned the district.</seg>
<seg id="1832">In the ghost town of Dzhantukha there are about fifty inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="1833">About 38 people live in Akarmara, in the other villages it looks similar.</seg>
<seg id="1834">The Khrushchev, which still house one or two families, one recognizes at the balconies, where laundry is dried.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Two young girls, both seven years old, look out of the window of a destroyed house.</seg>

<seg id="1839">The girl whispers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear.</seg>
<seg id="1840">Many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called Tkugelalugol.</seg>
<seg id="1841">Families are also involved in the subsistence economy (farming of agricultural products for their own needs) such as livestock breeding, beekeeping and vegetable cultivation.</seg>
<seg id="1842">It is difficult to get over the rounds.</seg>
<seg id="1843">In winter, the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages.</seg>

<seg id="1848">Despite her eldest daughter, who lives in France, Galina did not leave Abkhazia to live with her. "my heart will remain forever in Abkhazia," she tells.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Galina does not want to receive financial support from her daughter and insists that she is instead supporting her young grandchildren.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the names of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez says, the people come to the full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying: "mom Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also slept on cartons outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys drugs that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa is an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family arrived from Angola to Brazil, hoping to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he responds with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already speaking to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic and Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his trip to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "" "" "" "he responds smiling." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," he says. "" "" "" "" I have experienced what they are experiencing. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children in front of people who wanted to get money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travelers see their telephones calmly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she has a lot of photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a female, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, as she briefly introduces them to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users to say,</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of the town Urumqi received a cell phone message in which they had the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged news with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police said that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is the blocking of pornographic websites, online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to alert users how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network remotely.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, with the filters for minors, is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experiences of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often sombre for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China," published on Twitter, published the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen asked the residents to check if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use appliances that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China," also published a Jingwang product description, which indicates that the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions given by the City Council to minimise the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions associated with the party, including universities and research institutes, are required to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on June 27, in a district of Urumqi, the authorities published a regulation with the statement to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1st their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" be registered at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos, but this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he looses to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; the year when Israel finished his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyees (like: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioned her well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as oriental idealism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman relevance, but also in cities that from Damascus to Syria reach completely to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking, and he can feel according to his own statement with the people suffering from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't openly admit it, he hates a special aversion against U.S. foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he says himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "" "" "emphasizes Hdaib." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he poured into water soluble Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the bats speak lukewarm coffee and the vests of the Kent cigar in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you take a look at neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as to drink in the public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The member and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had just been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also state that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism which injects the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continued to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simple rhetoric, but actually reflects an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib drew up traditional gender norms by shaping his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of 'honorary murders' has been accepted in Jordan - the official outside of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honours reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still striking that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law of anti-crime legislation in 1954, women who are exposed to the threat of domestic violence can "be imprisoned for indefinite time in prison," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs music is also very popular and is well-known to not shy away from subjects that remain as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I was danced with politics," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it too." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, heterogenei- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan is talking about the rights of gay men and lesbians, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib launched an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to memorize later that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was streamed only a edited version," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and advocates that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nudie, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nudie, who later should work on behalf of the caliphes, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan don't?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the hashemic kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service arrested several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, arguing that they have critically commented on comments in social media dealing with the corruption that was deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row but the way of progress - so it looks Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, straightening and artificially created democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many parts of Tohocus. another theory states that the fortresses, drums and dancing have been passed over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, into the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two ballads are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and personal care were rare as in this story, as they help keep Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital city - a region with a very high crime rate where street smokers and illegal drugs trafficking are all-day.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the fancy hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens enter the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these sophisticated hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other in order to show who can create the most eccentric looks on how to see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Education institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who are located in El Callao, have found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get training in the hairdresser's art instead of bad advice, which makes it possible for them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we built this educational community out of love with the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the article entitled "Lovemaking messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write letters of love to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel disadvantaged?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la Reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was deemed to be so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and were carrying weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now enter its ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we are writing thousands of letters of love to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people in the most urgent need this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan came to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp in order to convey the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done before in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the student student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla warriors.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL grenade launcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "I said to him," "" "" "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "" "" "he replied," "" "" "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life someone wrote something like that, so I answer to it. "suddenly, the tears ran over my cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and placed me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, it was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this struggle, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else of life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve it and its six brothers in front of starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices, new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice done on the part of the state on the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people, whom I often saw as monsters and even had learned hate, are only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commandant of the camp at Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian people were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, to lift themselves up and to protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2253">After a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">Out of fear for her life she moved to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone I thought he was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove that shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents passed the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "" "" "how long will you still escape the family, you stain?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which curses were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my masculine name is still on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim name, a kaucastic name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I got threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"" "" "" "they called me, wrote me," "" "" "" "relatives, strangers, some completely unknown." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that everything was just gossip, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother in the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "They have brought a monster that is not only your family, but the whole republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you're a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window a car with a darkened window panes and a numberplate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them, without registering myself, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe me, you're in security just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you plug. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some traditional Caribbean elements still carry me in." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chatting with camera, I really try to figure out how the person looks at her from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I filed a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"" "" "" "OC Media: are gay men still held in these secrets?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not so many people.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been abandoned by their relatives to stand up to Kadyrows.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are recorded there, so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and say they have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared but specifically submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was in the process when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports about it yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else wouldn't it have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia originally intended to introduce us to" "" "" "" "civilisation" "" "" "", "but finally threw us back into the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "OC Media: how is this possible under the law of sharia?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, wore tubjeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never scratched a hair." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Khardama Kharkov. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just shut their eyes ahead of you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"" "" "" "they never offended me, never hunted and never struck." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morals on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed before and laughed at once looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I returned home I could feel the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you now go to?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacreff, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I picked up the places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am Muslims and want to help those who need help." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschoff?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">It is nature that has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechnye who want to keep you with foam before the mouth that there are no bobbins with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have which, the cabarins have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there is it - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transient to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For the past few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he felt ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video that was shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani-Hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on site warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all the fathers of the family who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi are suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, based on a large part of the Arab Ahwa community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livelihoods.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields currently occurring in Iran, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has built a large number of dams that divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only resulted in deteriorating devastation caused by dryness in the region, destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youth rose to 81% now.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Collaborative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, finished the primary school 55% completed secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "" "" "a" "" "" "" "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination" led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahmad men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Dohii said that especially unemployment has become worse." "" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging from Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefers Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi and thus be hired, as even Arabic names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi had to endure, human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world awakens and takes knowledge of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectionals not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even think well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, nowadays, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk on skin colour, on racism, black cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused with segregation and discrimination, both in and out of feminist movement, many white feminists have left silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" sing Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to mention that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or above, that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership as white women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustices in her thinking, which refer to both the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a horrible and marginalized being in historical terms.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that, moreover, absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. some of them will continue to disclose the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins and isolate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join me with the movement of womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that Intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we can define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanarianism: reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanismus: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena because of maltreatment, the actenacious view of Ada Báez used nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women give an indication at all, they generally do not receive any support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must report at all with the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents1 Strike and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not forbid 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation hits and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different reports and reports that do not even approach the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay" she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney Office reached 9600 ads because of domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police were reported by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence among the peacekeepers. here too, 86% of women's advertisements came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Minister of Women, Ana Baiardi will show only a few of these crimes. "on any woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on every woman compensated for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "" "" "" "said she at the end of 2014." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone journalists included at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay, a woman died due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she did. this should always repent her.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she carried out psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too submissive, because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told them how he had isolated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had dropped out of Carlos for so long and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment would at least have a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te creo ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of mistreatment in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias's case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She took a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her native country in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good, but not applied." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed at the Paraguayan Parliament, known as the hashtag # Porellas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# Noninvasive) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to declare Femizid on an independent criminal record and to punish those who are already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legal text has been changed in some ways in order to win delegates to the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions will be levelled, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original draft bill had envisaged the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence currently have to carry, if they just want to permit and maintain a secure housing, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a rethinking must take place here, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2537">He who is silent in the face of these facts complicates himself and contributes to the execution of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to refund for such a long time until abuse is no longer considered normal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law had been changed, among other things, a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the cancellation of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is regarded as a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this website was blocked because of a decision by the Minister of Information" "" "" "" "on the website of the banned newspaper Azamn." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Indian authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn because of their coverage of corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he served a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and placed in court but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after having dismissed his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular the domestic secret service, to restrict public freedoms, including press freedom, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and detain.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities violate peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens from expressing their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and imprisonment for three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper, in which since its founding in 2007, corruption was reported in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim al-Maamari, editor in chief of Azamn, arrested an article entitled "High-level parties bind hands of justice" in the newspaper on July 26, 2016. in this it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in court decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Issue of the newspaper Azamn from July 26, 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading: "high-ranking parties bind the hands of the judiciary."</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, a member of the Board of Directors, was invited to the Special Department from the ISS and arrested upon his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS resumed Deputy Chief Editor Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as chief editor for Al-Maamaris arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information admitted the statement that "the publication and circulation of the newspaper on any road, including online, will be banned from August 9, 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial was held before the Court of Masquerade in the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms, and ordered the newspaper's final closure.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, among other things, for a disturbance of the public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining of the prestige of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">Al-Haj was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of 3,000 omania rial (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 U.S. dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for the spread of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit of 5000 oman Rial (13,000 US dollars) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but Al-Haj sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the Central Prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison where he served his one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the court's decision to relinquish Azamn, the newspaper still faces attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of "Azamn" was extended for three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the Appeals Court to repress the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closing of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the continued shutdown of Azamn and the detainment of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the Indian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf centre for human rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the Mexican authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn, so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. in all circumstances, to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of reprisals, including judicial killings.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Gulf centre for human rights (Gulf Center for Human Rights, GCHR) is an independent, non-profit and non-governmental organization that supports human rights defenders (even independent journalists, bloggers, lawyers, etc.) in the Gulf region and in adjoining states by promoting freedom of expression and association, and the right to gather, support and provide protection.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with its agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: firstly, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare system that cover specific medical needs on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, carried out by African scientists, helps build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Research on Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic first showed serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the use of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also launching a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Q: what do you think is the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being makers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it's the limited speed to do things, and the more difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines can only make items accessible to pay (the so-called "Paywall") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how open source seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This paper by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding Salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he couldn't use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents pose not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cardboard varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but it takes longer, since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if there is a boulder in a river that I have to do." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "" "" "we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand firm to court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce, because all the features are already patented. "so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the USA and throughout the world: open Source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the ISS international space station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salat of the variety Outredgeous in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the move from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source seed initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders allow only others who buy their seeds to breed it so as to breed their own varieties, and not to sow them immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">More bleak prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg take control of the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the open-source movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," he says and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is, for example, on farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seeds available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is therefore always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of OSSI, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all antitrust characters are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be used either at all or only aggravated.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimations are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat can be patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visible</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specific desired traits - from those through which their taste or colour improves until such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics suggest that the available plant material for breeders takes more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four co-banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts that intellectual property protects other breeders because "patents and the protection of plant varieties encourage innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection doesn't inhibit innovations, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: for 20 years to wait until a patent is running, there are certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait long for breeding plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it remains to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to ease their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and the latest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">On the whole, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we do not really create the characteristics ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the U.S. state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety also breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation are mainly used herbicides, grow into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) have patents, they create the most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative because of avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that have patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know my competitors will sell my varieties themselves in a few years, "he says." with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy for my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, carries out an open source seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional farm varieties, the centre with farmers works together and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to open source seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agreements is working on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of OSSI commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the OSSI commitment cannot simply be taken over by one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows for patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">A statement, however, is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn something about the "open source seed" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seed.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which scheduled next year will be the official launch.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A combination of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group for erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon see him.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around 5th August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANNUI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">Despite this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, who are supposed to defend the law, it has never been as important as now. ANNUI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to yield. we insist on further fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANNUI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, for example the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">Besides ANTHI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researchers Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "well, the blog he set up to circumvent the Egyptian government's appliance is the goal of an attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider who is also home to Ziadas blog, is on the other hand more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting on the student protests and recorded a video of how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blocking and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blogging of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey the feeling of a state of siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, an unloading at the National Security Council, the blogging blogs as well as any other website I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post items to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous are going the way until the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August 133 Websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone, and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Moreover, afte documented the blocking of providers by transferring internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web sites that VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices indicate the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed in court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers across Brazil are reporting gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the country's second largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves robbed the pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air wafts to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The newspaper "Extra" published in Rio for detailed reporting on Violence in Rio published the editorial "This is not normal" in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio, is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper on the whole world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to obscure the atrocities of the police that only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira reargues that violence as a "war" argues. this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account responsibility for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the Federal State of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2780">The company Globo, the largest media company in South America, has recently reiterated the security policy of the state for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the founding of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit that was set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to conquer a Favela by deploying a massive police order and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease in forcible deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has become increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repressions against the poor municipalities that should protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria laid down by the Geneva Convention - the criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to deploy means and means that are typical of a war. this involves entering the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an obscure point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "blinded spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police arrive at the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Amid all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit vendor died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Syria peace organization PAX and the Syria Institute's research institute, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently are about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where chemical weapons attack on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas have been besieged by rebel controlled areas outside Damascus, leading to the fact that residents are dependent on local food or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghouta how they can plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food products planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The project Directorate, Abo Nabil, said AFP to the French news agency:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we chose cultivating mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organisers, reports Global Voices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it is now becoming more and more known. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, we use the Humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 family knowledge of planting mushrooms, thus Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12.700 €but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, September 4th, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the shortage of fuel, locally produced fuel is made of plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started the "production of mushroom seeds from the regions," before checking their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. as this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms all over East Ghouta for free.</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for victims of 2017 fires</seg>
<seg id="2833">On October 21, several hundred people protested in many regional capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for victims of fires rampant in the north of Portugal in the week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of forest fires between 15 and 16 October.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which oversees the forest surfaces per satellite, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there are only in four districts no fire.</seg>

<seg id="2844">The foreseeable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soveral from the federal government of Portugal declared the Público newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this anywhere: there are dozens of open roads that were surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">In the woods of Leiria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June, as the streets were closed very late. "</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, building approvals in locations with high risk of fire are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought to grave fires in 2003 and 2005, was criticized by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had the means for self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval also continued in the same article of the Público newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, spread to fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when inhabitants looked for information or tried to contact their relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: it took advantage of their own civil protection data using the fogos.pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in autumn 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groups that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan last time with his family during dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't say it at that time she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never any more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many haiara felt protected.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a few years. the work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar which were heavier than himself in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we mounted nylon in front of the open windows, so that we could not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his request for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago, Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin ratios. it is also true that the conditions that apply to asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system" "" "" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." this involves improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can go for months after registering the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either reliant on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unconditional way of living helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of construction work in the construction industry, Asharper put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food stop.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghans operated companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant on the Orient, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs targets extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail trade and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a Kabul factory in which people can learn packaging and preservatives. "so they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he also wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocate's Netizen-Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft law that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use social networks within six months of a successful legislative decision on the authority's website stating their full name as well as their ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who fails to take this step may be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the prosecution of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by 60 Members of Parliament, is currently preceded by the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in May another member of the Parliament filed a bill that would be harder for insulting the president or high officials." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Egypt's right to insult the president as well as state institutions is already punishable. under the legislative proposal, such action would, however, be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that had led to the removal of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan, like more than 700 protesters, who had been arrested at the same incident, waited four years in prison for a court date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed until the 20th May, because the prison administration has failed to bring the defendant to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, including the floodlight of weapons of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza spoke the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi sitting block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalist Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist on leaked documents interrogated</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly questioned by a leaked action plan. the plan explicitly comes from the President of the Republic, who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft law, which would ensure business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption accused officers of amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the website of Nawaat throws a light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which guarantees journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless he appeared in the district court in Tunis on the 09th of May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to submit their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new provisions of the information bureau of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the rules, it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments to be reached within social networks. it is not clear until now how authorities apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only selectively to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as the "organizer of the dissemination of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make the said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnclassniki (Russia's two popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ruled the blocking Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia admins refused to delete two English-speaking articles, the indications that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site had been blocked because it was "a source of information that collaborates with groups to raise a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop snooping down</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a deliberate consultation on elevated surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecoms companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, however, has left other technology companies and the civilian population outwardly.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
