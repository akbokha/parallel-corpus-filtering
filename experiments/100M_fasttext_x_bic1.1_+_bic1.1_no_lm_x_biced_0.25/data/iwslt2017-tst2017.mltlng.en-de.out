this is James Ris@@ en .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times rep@@ orter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service operation in which the CIA literally translated dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating cra@@ cks and promp@@ ting him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern , to condemn W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish confidential information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they are revealing .
so when the government kno@@ cked on cra@@ cks , he did something that many courage@@ ous rep@@ orters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they have been declar@@ ing for years that it is essential for their case , the demands of the government have been dropped against cra@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ orters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failing and tear@@ ing cra@@ cks , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have taken care of his telephone message home ,
just as his email data , financial and banking information , his credit card , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to judge Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and crack .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary was more condemned than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government ranks too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer who went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as the government allows government to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technology to better protect its sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist when tears had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today is enhanced by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , as is the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that all je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to apply mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer ,
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers modest and reported by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental cre@@ eper , who raises alarm to the poll@@ uted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that Rich and M@@ ighty Ones have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents from the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
the Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail boxes in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next un@@ veiled documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
it seems we@@ pt away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is that when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people make this whole world very conf@@ using and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
presum@@ ably because there were no prominent Americans who were in these revel@@ ations to this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school@@ children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here with Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator found himself as an African minister who wanted to bring a susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cked that all of us made suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not about a single peak politi@@ cian , wrapped in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very evil , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I do see that some things have begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has been gathering in central regi@@ sters on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have submitted a draft law in both Par@@ liament@@ ary Cham@@ bers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do @-@ firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency , which now makes this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , as I have almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Mac@@ ed@@ ra .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made an outlet store .
a guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip throughout the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusias@@ tically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock up there ?
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such fear that I got out of bed , sli@@ pping ti@@ p@@ to@@ es to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked out .
I think creativity can create it , transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how to make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded thus &quot; Air Matt@@ ress and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started star@@ ing .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
thus we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
via the internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the mis@@ sile to be ign@@ ited .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things that you can do well . we have been able to design .
at the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design do something like this ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree we trust .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seated neighbour .
this low flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger ?
most feel the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel like they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who actually has Al G@@ ores cell phone ?
could you please declare on Twitter that he is can@@ did@@ ly for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he came from , like his dog or his children ?
imagine that you would have 150 ratings , all of which say : &quot; he really can hold very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well @-@ thought @-@ through feedback system strengthens trust significantly .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give up negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both the hosts and guests had their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence .
it is little surprising that we trust people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by evalu@@ ations .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation im@@ poses common@@ alities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one can tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the inquiry is not accepted either .
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can I create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put away these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered beforehand .
for us , the business runs very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who un@@ allowed parties celebrated or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts will have guests standing in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
the dis@@ appointment that one h@@ ears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , the 123 million saved nights only had a fraction of a problem .
because people trust each other rightly .
if trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are a real guar@@ dian angel who can save lives , even though they don &apos;t know him properly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass some books .
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled across this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the thought of sharing coinci@@ de with money transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
but now it &apos;s easy to call the &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people lay a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it &apos;s easy to compare with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group there was waiting for Ans@@ wer to fill a thoroughly and show one in a bar pent@@ ine district that you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
nowadays homes are designed according to the principles of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of sharing ?
I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces that the government belonged to ,
residents were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay
were con@@ veys to people whose children were und@@ ressed . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes by .
of course , we know that design can &apos;t solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met Muslims : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull fitness fan@@ atic ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I was not born this way .
I decided to do that .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ te .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was for me a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I did not only passi@@ vely accept the faith of my parents .
I have struggl@@ ed with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; Break@@ ing News . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock turned into indig@@ nation quickly .
why should we do this ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern origin ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one from another citizen .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as I was driving in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid of being recognized as Muslims for the first time .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry . &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were thought to be Muslims , dra@@ gged and struck them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing to answer , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumour in the US body .
the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a couple of parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to observing people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant , and showing greater civi@@ c involvement .
and as I recently told me a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radic@@ alisation , it has been established that it begins on @-@ line . first , the person is cut off by their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
when Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations when recogni@@ zing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology in their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things in scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every spiritual man with whom she spoke was silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing , and something that their anger had made sense , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and their church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive way of a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study shows that when people submit messages on a negative impact on Muslims , they are rather att@@ un@@ ed to military attacks against Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood of Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to hollow out the fund@@ ament of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
with the assignment of collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ l@@ ete .
he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such a young man born out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited him in the afternoon .
he fired eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we op@@ ted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the nur@@ sery , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was stopped .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had encouraged courage and compassion to panic and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or you will join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who claim that you hold a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a land@@ lady with drau@@ ght , work in a noble thought factory , i.e. an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air package delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by means of inter@@ locking devices , flight units reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
they can also build self @-@ reli@@ ant resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be collective aware of where in space the mobile objects are located .
in our lab at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , one of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands can be executed at the highest level e. g . e. g . &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern track ,
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a fla@@ p .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a swe@@ eping side .
a restriction of stern star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that no matter in which position the flight device is able to reg@@ ain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask fundamental abstract questions which advance at the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a propeller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simpl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and Quer@@ ru@@ der , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is more mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life is very much so that it can fly reliably , and can move everywhere in the room .
yet it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right now is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
that &apos;s why it is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in the room in all directions , no matter which direction it is turned , or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ propeller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller is falling , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making half air@@ planes in@@ capable .
the final demonstration examined synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the most secure machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wage is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cled around each other in a very distant galax@@ y , transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment , they gle@@ amed bri@@ ghter than all stars along in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
1.3 billion years ago , many zel@@ liges living on the earth was created .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is on us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courage@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most people thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ ry gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved recognition performance .
therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final trial to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes crossed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the good@@ bye to my death @-@ sick father .
basically this was the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been exam@@ ining gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and her by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a c@@ abling in the structure of space and time .
when sur@@ passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
teacher in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often leads to a really al@@ ber@@ ty dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on sep@@ t@@ ember 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and smoked at the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that is why the Lig@@ o employees were driving nuts .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of a nucle@@ us of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are inv@@ entive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical . so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that will give you a great deal :
the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same is true of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the frequencies measured are within the audi@@ ble range .
so when we transform wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe .
listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping easily : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circle with an additional key change . this sounds like the wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of noise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold paras@@ ite , which turn around as fast as the sticks of your bl@@ ender .
AA : let us consider briefly what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
in this there is the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can not see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about them .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through , since these are opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate Iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is conce@@ aled by its own after@@ g@@ low .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that things exist that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of whom we have no idea of . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we did not expect .
my colleague am MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the type of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o watching them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so to say the suction no@@ oks for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and all .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start acting ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; my life changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that changed my life into an unexpected way . it began with a question of my little ones .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , is called by un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons .
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess I need milk for my bill @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on I always s@@ wore to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
but it also has an ast@@ oun@@ ding side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things out , stir you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , time four , 16 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
$ 350 million for a season .
in America , my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening .
my series in 256 regions all over the world are in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not just produced , so still on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to assemble my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you so that all of you who work as hard if you now run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I speak of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and fan@@ tasi@@ zing , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dreams in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
this is a high tone , delivering a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is cre@@ atively , mechan@@ ically , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is sum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people accept that when I explain to them the sums , I talk to writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does them .
but the bu@@ zz@@ ing -- when I started with television production when I began to work and work , build , create , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
sum@@ ming is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the sum@@ ming is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you can &apos;t strive for size differently .
the feeling of not being able to strive for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is called bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called Gen@@ ie .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more epis@@ odes , the more work there are , the more things work , the more things I observe , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the tot@@ als . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single work institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the hum@@ ming stopped .
the engine bu@@ zz@@ ed .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my tot@@ als were broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , elaborate weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titanium doesn &apos;t sleep , doesn &apos;t sleep with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love is suddenly f@@ aded away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ ze yourself , stupid author @-@ tit@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you love what you do , to be a teacher , to be a teacher , to be a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who &apos;s you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; Southern States wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; estimate . &quot;
she does not call no more &quot; valu@@ ables . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m Titan and my tot@@ als mo@@ urn , and everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon , I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and dam@@ p kis@@ ses , soft voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl lets go in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can barely breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am breathing .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the titanium frame , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe me using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
true tot@@ als are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply Love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic of any guilt .
it &apos;s law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not to me in a way as to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person is better than to be home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
we race around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst bubble bub@@ bles .
I feel stiff , absent and confused .
I always grab my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! say they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you probably right , but you can do it !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones don &apos;t want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes a day , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my fe@@ el@@ iness , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the bu@@ zz to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
15 minutes per piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working is not working without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never seen a Titan who takes a trip to Jerusalem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country I create , the marathon , I run , the troops , the canvas , the high tone , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sum : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , gru@@ elling , naked and new feeling of life spreads out in me .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more I know who I am .
I am the author . I think things out , I stir you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have every day dealing with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low ability to heal itself .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
they certainly have one of the best known ones , the &quot; Deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; an electro@@ de im@@ pl@@ uses deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurolog@@ ical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma the brain swell@@ s and increases the cran@@ ial pressure .
in order to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to allow cells to grow from a tissue sample is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly spread themselves and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our bra@@ ins .
they comprise 4 % of our cereb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ ex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they are responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why stay them ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so certain .
one thing , however , is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then mark color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we planted them at the acceptance test of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ gra@@ ft transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we plague these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we plague the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Professor Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we planted cells in a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury to and rei@@ m@@ pl@@ anti@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been stimul@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take for@@ age pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor function range in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic cereb@@ ral mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with ape .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left , they see the monkeys , who spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we planted cells : the same monkey , two months after mat@@ ting .
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant it in man .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill in about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you look further into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first of all , it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable devot@@ ion .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ lessly that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed democracy is f@@ ading with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clari@@ fied to me as Finance Minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ug@@ ly friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would abol@@ ish if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group think of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ enc@@ eless democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat of our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin peaks par@@ adox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of un@@ used cash owned by high net assets and corporations which , however , are too fear@@ ful to invest in where it would be productive and income with which one could pay the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , tril@@ lion US dollars were invested in the US , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars will sound after a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the $ 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely did nothing to infl@@ ame the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is stag@@ nant sal@@ aries , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that fears the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors that they do not invest in . just like O@@ edi@@ pus &apos;s father , who is out of fear , the proph@@ ecy of the O@@ rak@@ el could be true that his son would kill him if he &apos;s grown up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
all of the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially fund all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy naturally included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a mistake , however , to reduce the status of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclusi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it attracted the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mood in matters of state matters .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy did not last long --
like a candle lit very bri@@ ghtly , it is also rapidly burned out .
however , our liberal democra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our present democra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , by gradually under@@ mining politics and depri@@ ving them of politics .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not at a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because you can be in the government these days , and yet not in power , because the power of politics has mig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that have dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they are fed , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar with the economy that has so far har@@ med the policy that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being depreci@@ ated , the macro@@ economic demand falls , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managers of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this , by the way , is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t matter very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workforce through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as business and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , just as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we democra@@ ti@@ ze the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cra@@ cy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or something that the society resembles in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples .
in the business area : imagine a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from one place to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no more distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there that the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no ou@@ tri@@ ght twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it wasn &apos;t the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is also liber@@ alized in which it pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democra@@ tically .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce a massive decline in aggregate demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls for &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well too .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you consider from the viewpoint of the West to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to now repro@@ ach China to do what the West has done in the 19th century sm@@ ells enor@@ mously according to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected it was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back on the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Greece but the euro@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
namely , to say good @-@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive rejection line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have also chosen den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what &apos;s coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but if the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what are the changes you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- serious ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believed that there was an honest interest in the credi@@ tors &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but that was not possible .
they merely wanted to do our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that passed through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they have been conducting a dis@@ astro@@ us programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika len@@ ders who imposed this policy had conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ oss@@ al mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive ons@@ lau@@ ght of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not survi@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they don &apos;t survive , the released flee forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to propose a post @-@ modern 1930 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it appears to me , it will also be toler@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thanks so much for you were with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of you have never heard of Roy Price although he is probably responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon is producing .
of course , this is a highly competitive industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
they are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that ad@@ dic@@ tive , where after watching a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care to get to the left of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average out@@ cry , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not exc@@ ite .
so he has to make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create achievements .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon has nothing to do for free , do you use it , right ?
millions of viewers watch these epis@@ odes .
but they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you collect when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four rep@@ ubli@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many cannot remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of hosting a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they took a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that this should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimised by very powerful computers .
what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we are more and more focused on statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in jail .
if someone is in prison in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . it is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad type , by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news station . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked just fine , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could tell why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- in the workplace , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you have to do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , you put the individual parts together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a conclusion .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is important to re @-@ assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do otherwise . but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ query or no question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ use it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
however , as you naturally know if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
perhaps the ball will be wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what you do and take risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
