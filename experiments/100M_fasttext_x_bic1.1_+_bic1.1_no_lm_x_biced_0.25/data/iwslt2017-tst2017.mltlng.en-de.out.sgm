<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US secret service operation in which the CIA literally translated drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating cracks and prompting him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the government's pattern, to condemn Whistleblower and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if the media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they are revealing.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on cracks, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly, although they have been declaring for years that it is essential for their case, the demands of the government have been dropped against cracks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and tearing cracks, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have taken care of his telephone message home,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just as his email data, financial and banking information, his credit card, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary was more condemned than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government ranks too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower who went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government allows government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technology to better protect its sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that didn't exist when tears had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and today is enhanced by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, as is the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that all jeopardize us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology partners such as Edward Snowden have a way to apply misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about grievances in the supply of soldiers modest and reported by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental creeper, who raises alarm to the polluted water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that Rich and Mighty Ones have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mail boxes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of $2 billion leads to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John-Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems wept away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are used by some few to hide and disguise their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people make this whole world very confusing and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans who were in these revelations to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states there is less information needed to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator found himself as an African minister who wanted to bring a suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked that all of us made suggestions on how to transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single peak politician, wrapped in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very evil, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I do see that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "since then, the EU has been gathering in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have submitted a draft law in both Parliamentary Chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo-firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need managers in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency, which now makes this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I have almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Macedra.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made an outlet store.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip throughout the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard myself saying," "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "one voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Well, how please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what did I rock up there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "what if he's mad?" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such fear that I got out of bed, slipping tiptoes to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked out.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it, transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how to make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded thus "Air Mattress and Breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started staring.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Via the internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to be ignited.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on things that you can do well. we have been able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree we trust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seated neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This low flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel like they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please declare on Twitter that he is candidly for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told where he came from, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 ratings, all of which say: "he really can hold very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well-thought-through feedback system strengthens trust significantly.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give up negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both the hosts and guests had their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">It is little surprising that we trust people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's reputation -- in our case by evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation imposes commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "if you tell too little, for example," "" "" "" "Hi!" "" "" "", "you don't get an answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">One can tell too much, for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the inquiry is not accepted either.</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "great works of art in your apartment! I make a holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put away these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who unallowed parties celebrated or ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts will have guests standing in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million saved nights only had a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are a real guardian angel who can save lives, even though they don't know him properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass some books.</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled across this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing coincide with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">But now it's easy to call the "rental industry," the thing is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="228">"" "" "" "share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it's easy to compare with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group there was waiting for Answer to fill a thoroughly and show one in a bar pentine district that you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays homes are designed according to the principles of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. lots of parking spaces that the government belonged to,</seg>
<seg id="240">Residents were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">Were conveys to people whose children were undressed. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes by.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design can't solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>

<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "" "" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was for me a feminist declaration of independence, in contrast to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only passively accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and believed in the end.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "Breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical failure?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do this?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "..." Middle Eastern origin... "..." Jihad... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It was not only my country being attacked, but in Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspicious one from another citizen.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as I was driving in silence -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was afraid of being recognized as Muslims for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be vigilant," "Be careful," "Remain in well lit areas," "Don't worry."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed in the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "" "" "and again the warnings came:" "" "" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were thought to be Muslims, dragged and struck them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing to answer, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumour in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a couple of parking spaces, but don't stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to observing people of other faiths more tolerant, and showing greater civic involvement.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I recently told me a head of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation, it has been established that it begins on-line. first, the person is cut off by their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations when recognizing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups maintain their ideology in their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "" "" "but when one looks at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things in scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every spiritual man with whom she spoke was silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing, and something that their anger had made sense, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive way of a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when people submit messages on a negative impact on Muslims, they are rather attuned to military attacks against Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims' rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood of Muslims shot up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to hollow out the fundament of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">With the assignment of collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when is such a young man born out of my brother?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who visited him in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one thing that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery, we drove silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had encouraged courage and compassion to panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who claim that you hold a TEDTalk, a landlady with draught, work in a noble thought factory, i.e. an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the largest study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to rule.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before air package delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By means of interlocking devices, flight units reach high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-reliant resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "our goal is to cross the limits of possible in autonomous flight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collective aware of where in space the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our lab at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, one of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands can be executed at the highest level e. g. e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern track,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a sweeping side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that no matter in which position the flight device is able to regain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask fundamental abstract questions which advance at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and Querruder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is more mechanically simple, the inner life is very much so that it can fly reliably, and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Yet it doesn't have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right now is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That's why it is ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the room in all directions, no matter which direction it is turned, or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller is falling, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half airplanes incapable.</seg>
<seg id="458">The final demonstration examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you will motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The most secure machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wage is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very distant galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment, they gleamed brighter than all stars along in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, many zelliges living on the earth was created.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is on us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometry gravitational-wave observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final trial to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes crossed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically this was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examining gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and her by observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cabling in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When surpassing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Teacher in courses on relativity theory often leads to a really alberty dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On september 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked at the arrival of the waves. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. that is why the Ligo employees were driving nuts.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of a nucleus of a nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that will give you a great deal:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same is true of gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the frequencies measured are within the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transform wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping easily: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circle with an additional key change. this sounds like the wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender of noise] Somebody who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold parasite, which turn around as fast as the sticks of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can not see -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, since these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate Iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first few minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is concealed by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that things exist that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of whom we have no idea of. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague am MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the type of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo watching them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the suction nooks for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for a year I would say" "" "" "" "Yes!" "" "" "" "I was afraid of." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Do I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start acting?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" my life changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life into an unexpected way. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, is called by unexplainable reasons.</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I guess I need milk for my bill-cup." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "" "" "she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on I always swore to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astounding side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things out, stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program to the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, time four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run one after another on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">My series in 256 regions all over the world are in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not just produced, so still on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to assemble my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work as hard if you now run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I speak of work, so that you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and fantasizing, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreams in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">This is a high tone, delivering a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creatively, mechanically, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is summing.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept that when I explain to them the sums, I talk to writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does them.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzzing -- when I started with television production when I began to work and work, build, create, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">Summing is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the summing is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you can't strive for size differently.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to strive for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things work, the more things I observe, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the totals. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single work institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says:" "" "" "" "estimate, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzzed.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My totals were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, elaborate weekends, no remorse, nothing delegating, a titanium doesn't sleep, doesn't sleep with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no summing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love is suddenly faded away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "haze yourself, stupid author-titan." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you love what you do, to be a teacher, to be a teacher, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz when the buzzing stops, who's you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "Southern States waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "I am on the way outside, late and she says," "" "" "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call no more "valuables."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I hate it when I'm Titan and my totals mourn, and everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says," "" "" "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "" "" "and I say," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon, I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and damp kisses, soft voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl lets go in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can barely breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am breathing.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that's not right away, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the titanium frame, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe me using broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzzing is the stream that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True totals are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply Love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not to me in a way as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person is better than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We race around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We do small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst bubble bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totality of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! say they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You probably right, but you can do it!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones don't want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenie-daughter for a whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes a day, even at a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feeliness, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the buzz to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training, when I wanted to exceed myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes per piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my free time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I listen to an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never seen a Titan who takes a trip to Jerusalem." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country I create, the marathon, I run, the troops, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right sum: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, gruelling, naked and new feeling of life spreads out in me.</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this buzz, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am the author. I think things out, I stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "" "" "I said" "" "" "" "Yes" "" "" "" "for less work and more games." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have every day dealing with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a heavy stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the best known ones, the "Deep-brain stimulation." an electrode impluses deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was chief doctor and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that in skull-brain trauma the brain swells and increases the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To allow cells to grow from a tissue sample is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François was able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread themselves and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brains.</seg>
<seg id="841">They comprise 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they are responsible for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay them?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then mark color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planted them at the acceptance test of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autograft transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we plague these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we plague the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Professor Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planted cells in a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury to and reimplantiated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been stimulated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take forage pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor function range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic cerebral mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with ape.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted its own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkeys, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we planted cells: the same monkey, two months after matting.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you look further into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients who perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First of all, it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable devotion.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved doubtlessly that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "indeed democracy is fading with us, in Europe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clarified to me as Finance Minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my ugly friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would abolish if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group think of a mistake, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for without democracy our societies are blamed, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat of our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peaks paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash owned by high net assets and corporations which, however, are too fearful to invest in where it would be productive and income with which one could pay the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, trillion US dollars were invested in the US, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars will sound after a lot of money until it compares with the $5,1 trillion which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely did nothing to inflame the stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant salaries, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand that fears the pessimism of investors that they do not invest in. just like Oedipus's father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the Orakel could be true that his son would kill him if he's grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances lead to the fact that Oedipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All of the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially fund all the technologies, "green" technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenical democracy naturally included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it would be a mistake, however, to reduce the status of Athenian democracy based on these exclusions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it attracted the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same mood in matters of state matters.</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenical democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle lit very brightly, it is also rapidly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics, while the economy -- the world of the corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present democracies, since the time this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place, by gradually undermining politics and depriving them of politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government these days, and yet not in power, because the power of politics has migrated to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that have decimated the animals from which they are fed, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar with the economy that has so far harmed the policy that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being depreciated, the macroeconomic demand falls, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managers of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and the economy back together, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This, by the way, is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't matter very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workforce through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as business and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, just as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," or something that the society resembles in "Star Trek" in which machines serve people and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" Matrix "like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the business area: imagine a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital will follow you from one place to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and redeeming, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No more distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there that the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no outright twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade in this currency is traded -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it wasn't the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is also liberalized in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce a massive decline in aggregate demand, what Larry Summers calls for "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is small.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am completely confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well too.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have clearly stated what you consider from the viewpoint of the West to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I may say so provocatively, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "to now reproach China to do what the West has done in the 19th century smells enormously according to hypocrisy." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1038">Most of you have never heard of Roy Price although he is probably responsible for 22 medium minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "" "" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "" "" "movies, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and the content that Amazon is producing.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a highly competitive industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">They are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that addictive, where after watching a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "" "" "Roy Price doesn't care to get to the left of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid" "" "" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average outcry, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create achievements.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon has nothing to do for free, do you use it, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You collect when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip over or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "" "" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican U.S. Senators." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many cannot remember this show because it wasn't so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- as the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they took a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that this should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimised by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">What you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, it is a bit scary because we live in a time where we are more and more focused on statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the Multi-Health Systems company?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. it is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis they can predict outbreaks of flu, the bad type, by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news station. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked just fine, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could tell why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life -- in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you have to do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second, you put the individual parts together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is important to re-assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what they wouldn't have been able to do otherwise. but the decision on how to take all these parts again and make it a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "" "" "we tell us the data." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a jquery or no question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you naturally know if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">Perhaps the ball will be wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
