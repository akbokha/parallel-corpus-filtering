Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are to meet today .
a pit chapel , where it is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , because the car navigation system was a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bayern of the State Government , are anything but current - but very revealing .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet , which one does not immediately recognise as such .
in the large over@@ sight card , detailed maps were drawn up for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called documents of documents .
according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business , these were developed between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and have emerged from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops finally drew off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , today &apos;s neighbors , who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph continued the project , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the judgment sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling became a member of the Munich subur@@ b for 21 years after the map was created .
today , sub @-@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers &quot; uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written fl@@ ur@@ ries from the so @-@ called &quot; urine @-@ mount &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
small plots there are no more farmers there today - but small farmers in the &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; plant .
a large green area is distinguished north of sub @-@ send@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the case of the documents , in the area of today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street name &quot; at Gast@@ eig &quot; or &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße people once locked people with del@@ usions .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle of Culture &quot; On the Au@@ er Venti@@ lation &quot; was created .
from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the bet@@ ting of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first room , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Ref@@ ri@@ ger@@ ation Institution in Haar in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric clinics since 2006 .
young people now meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West lies the football field of the T@@ SV Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected - in architectural resem@@ b@@ lance to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ splatz , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; main place &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed a lot of holes in the city center .
a big one remained to this day - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business@@ men and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were prec@@ eded and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second subur@@ ban railway line took place .
with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Union for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and ra@@ cial attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Mis@@ sour@@ i State , which is expected to come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cially @-@ based incidents occur l@@ ately throughout the country , &quot; says it in the group &apos;s opinion .
a recent law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination complaints , and the state &apos;s law enforcement agencies which disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to issue travel warnings , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of the civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group c@@ ited incidents such as rac@@ ist aband@@ on@@ ment against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report issued by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will hold 75 percent more common than whit@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring che@@ wing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s hate crime report , which acc@@ entu@@ ated the state in relation to the number of such violations in the 16th ranking of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of residential or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states ob@@ lige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view of further road profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
electric fence project is elementary
the fishing bacher Wei@@ de@@ zau@@ n @-@ Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members of parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac got a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ associated association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the right wing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm in which he manages 55 hectares of la@@ wns and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens and houses holiday palaces in five apartments .
the &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is for him the alternative marketing road for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
only region@@ als can be found on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ae@@ este .
since he is also BL@@ HV president of Fisch@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; elementary important . &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep areas .
the green area provides a lot of work , much has to be mach@@ ined with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental leave and managed to manage this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not perform bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognized the meaning of the fence project and is happy about the leader advancement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per h@@ ect@@ are .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion .
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced .
the open @-@ air area therefore amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ear@@ med up to at least 2023 .
half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ s@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 610 Euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ women you don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Architecture ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will allow the state funding of white f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the prerequis@@ ite is the presence of a conveyor set described by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the f@@ enced area may not be tu@@ g@@ able ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the F@@ ish@@ bacher Wei@@ dez@@ ine project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently running .
the open @-@ air area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the sur@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans cher@@ ish these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals on the dr@@ astic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have bot@@ her@@ ed him if he had done it .
but it took its importance , and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
the poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is properly speaking , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your oppressed masses who are longing to breathe freely , &quot; the mis@@ erable waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tr@@ ump@@ et USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s meaning .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical diagram .
Laz@@ arus altered this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atism that brings the American flame to the sealed world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , el@@ enden , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump never want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power ign@@ ites .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members from the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle reminds of a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the United Kingdom team
the performance director of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ re will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK have to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that there is something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .
British Field Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the crew to captain of the team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth world championships in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Scot@@ sman are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which is to be observed after a great season that included the victory of the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enor@@ mously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases they are also involved in the medals and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being a special team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me , it makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dia .
what concerns my speech as captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and there will be just such a great atmosphere outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics over Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the local vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he ino@@ cul@@ ated with the criticism , certainly .
but he did not put his critics into silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and this is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dism@@ issed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary hot head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .
he was also very sk@@ il@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and play his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of individuals who come to the side of the Gover@@ nor - which is a public forum , is considered officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans champ@@ ion@@ ed the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are just genuine people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
At@@ tor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not water @-@ filled , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective deployment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the Gover@@ nor described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County finally injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable meal had a similar effect on the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter recor@@ ders suggested to his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ cio , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain over@@ power his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online paper of George Washington Project .
but he didn &apos;t put them into silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and discourse belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for hom@@ ey comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which last year led to the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance @-@ Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he stuck this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we always cher@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on home soil .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer risk by passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking on lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works at the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; are more or less in the times , &quot; says the director of the Fred Hein@@ ze building .
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than anticipated , as in the underground much se@@ amounts , which is not noted in the plans .
traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction work , is a big problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers before red lights and lock@@ ers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z explains .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai government in the in@@ tran@@ quil in@@ dones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the sal@@ ted tu@@ ber is removed with di@@ ligent , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. to wash clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many people drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote by public lifting in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ dians from it .
in 2003 , the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , while the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from cor@@ rug@@ ated roofs , which were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by r@@ ust .
only very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans learned a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , hand woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their light skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has min@@ ed gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military is maintaining a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tort@@ ured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal land in the 1970 &quot; s were committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture , rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incident occurs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screws have intensi@@ fied , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economies come from the popul@@ ous Islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ fare cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the indigenous pap@@ ua - the Mama Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ o@@ is &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took off their tone and later returned with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , ch@@ ased and sm@@ ote the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ tes , said sacrifices and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
one child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was beaten so severely that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the or@@ phan@@ age dance - running in the circle and im@@ i@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began hur@@ ting stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that has not been released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TIME on the veranda of his multic@@ ol@@ ored painted wooden house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kay@@ ak still does not know who fired , but says that the sphere of the ranks of the soldiers assembled here came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who only bears a name like many Indones@@ ians , the TIME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers only wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &quot; filtered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he will set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the laying down of historical violations of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on June 5th in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is legally regulated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.@@ N. accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fier@@ y un@@ belief .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the idea that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not cease .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confron@@ tation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s headquarters .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning subsidies .
but local people say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , like TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on attra@@ cting the officers involved and with@@ drawing the police &apos;s mobile brig@@ ade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ memorial for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribe of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by launching spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ OP@@ M leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; security of national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold to the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10,000 Indones@@ ian Rup@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over the years , economic ine@@ qualities have grown among the local Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions of international media coverage remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were dep@@ orted due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the vice @-@ president of Human Rights Watch , the promises were not realized by Jok@@ o@@ is &apos;s election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s in@@ tran@@ quil eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - set up the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
historically , the same countries have supported OP@@ M .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alle@@ g@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local governments want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , on 4 May , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua people say that they will probably not be voted again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , are in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ed victims carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the bodies of an victim were buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire captured the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , by coinci@@ dentally calling the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch Building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from the cl@@ adding , the outer cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has gone through with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the Davis Cup single was not supported by the required two @-@ third majority for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two odds .
the often very long , but also therefore highly valued five @-@ set classics are preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to work on improving the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not until the vote , after many claims , the proposal had come before the proposal to cast out the finale at a neutral location .
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively minor details : the fin@@ alists will be the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup next year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organiz@@ er , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring forbidden items into the aircraft , find a survey
a survey carried out below shows that more than 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously prohibited items were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden kni@@ ves or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they were late discovered that they were mistakenly using fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , - also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules .
from those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted that they had kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally to@@ wed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent admitted to have kno@@ w@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ors also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed goods had caused the airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed goods - kno@@ w@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry through the safety , those who are most frequently flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of them .
so it &apos;s no surprise that the largest amount of liquids purchased by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while , people thought T@@ SA could watch books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k exc@@ els with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ committ@@ al reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la leader El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less brilliant figure in the announcement of the recent quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn from the total 5@@ 18.@@ 000 pre @-@ orders .
critics had repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
at the moment , 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations occur at a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all models should be taken together in 2018 - 500@@ .000 , 2020 a million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , reservations are made per day of 1800 .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today must reck@@ on with the delivery at the earliest in the second half of the year - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines that are never tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to larger delays , then the obligation of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent uns@@ atis@@ fied customers from being run away in flocks .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt is moving from the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environment Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more respon@@ sive to the needs of the governmental environmental authorities than previous administ@@ rations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is a deadline agreed on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for soil @-@ related o@@ zone .
P@@ ru@@ itt explained in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was a prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations aimed at resist@@ ing the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden shift from Wednesday is the latest legal advice for the section regulatory roll back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methane le@@ cks .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former administ@@ rations , the EPA often failed to comply with dead@@ lines for the execution and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activists groups and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take the dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority we give us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the EPA statement said that at some point P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; power to delay and all other legal powers available &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York &apos;s At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Ma@@ ine , Massachus@@ etts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for a sudden change of course .
&quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental poll@@ s and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm a ser@@ en@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and promot@@ er tum@@ ours their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Martini acc@@ entu@@ ates : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer registry : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen together with V@@ og@@ t@@ ei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark of silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or pat@@ ron@@ age belonged and not the other way around .
so there were also people living there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the most beautiful village of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ pin these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age came from Early Middle Ages .
a master , who built a church , buried and occupied with a priest , remained owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to present a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two is broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were placed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church @-@ chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the victims of hearing Swiss .
in 18@@ 23 the gra@@ vey@@ ard was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was ab@@ orted .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 , a storm collap@@ sed and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was ab@@ orted .
only today &apos;s existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em care for the &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius facility .
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc meet on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery at St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the programme starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
to conclude the ser@@ en@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade is only held in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility , which is important for tum@@ ours and listeners .
the friends and promot@@ ers of ours feel particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organiz@@ er Walter Martini confirms .
association wants to examine the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see legal requirements for construction and has therefore turned to the Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars out &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
they are illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen a wind power concentration zone existed only at the time in Vier@@ sen .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes wind energy util@@ isation for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
only a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but this had not been approved by the Düsseldorf District government because of a formation error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the granted permission is still illegal and therefore also to take back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance to the call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been in Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle marks it as an occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
however , they do not mean that the procedure is stopped .
looking at the proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association .
new Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four turbines , each with a height of 200 metres , on the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 h@@ ect@@ are site .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wishes to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other people were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police reports , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car went to Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the Gewerbe@@ verein and Municipal Auth@@ orities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , in order to attract the residents to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
as the chairman of the Trade Association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket products .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms should present their apprentices@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the Mit@@ ter@@ bury shopping spre@@ e .
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
the municipal administration and the business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
with this the business association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well as well as on Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost the city center while shopping .
in the end all would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city center - up to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and associations .
to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly multip@@ lied , King had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , shared with the fact that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day the nation@@ wide , five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities take part in the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mm@@ er@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverti@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ ump placed under pressure after the le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump in a phone with the Mexican president En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to called on to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president declared him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him : &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and dis@@ closed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade advised by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after Mr. Turn@@ bull said , &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massac@@ res : activists lead ra@@ cial ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ year @-@ old Ford Mercury launched a group of spectators in the Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ inks to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long turn on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors , the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want that n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cry broke the silence when a young black man was pulled out by the passenger seat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luckily , this terrible scene played on July 22nd is just a reproduction .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost everyone in the audience threw a si@@ gh of si@@ gh .
since 2005 citizens have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps organizing the post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it &apos;s a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil servant .
for him , im@@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe Society that an injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician att@@ aches a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chen on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of being involved in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black inhabitants of Georgia to vote for their vote in the summer campaign .
about the same time as the election , according to the F@@ BI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com did a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - suppos@@ edly because of a woman .
bro@@ oks said that the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they moved from prison and approaching the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution that was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bro@@ oks even form@@ ulates it more conc@@ isely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is illu@@ stra@@ tive , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of which want to believe that it does not exist in America anymore .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with his u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene had a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of chief C@@ lan@@ co member for many years , but he said that the role will never be simpler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ ss Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tried their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch of my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gr@@ ass@@ land re@@ jects the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ ed lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think White people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors was twe@@ aking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ionship replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this re@@ petition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots , and then still@@ ness .
a woman wearing a mour@@ ning dress stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays sad announcements of &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice is breaking with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it caught a group of about four dozen viewers sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .
a couple arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have lived through Georgi@@ an almost eight hours of time when Bro@@ oks carried them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels g@@ ho@@ stly .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse name .
children sit at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he is remember@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wi@@ pe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who has played the cl@@ an member .
Nick Ras@@ cona eng@@ ages two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talked about the post @-@ position with a black pair , which they just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky therefore fought to find words which feeling the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and doing that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks holds court at his table , he e@@ ats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reproduction is somehow inspiring because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have en@@ du@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own story , is do@@ omed to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sits on a multi @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a giant , six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar DEN@@ IC ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with a wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ stom@@ er &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine @-@ den@@ iers pose as Rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - which takes place through its &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine @-@ Mo@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise just like in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;

Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers surro@@ unds .
brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) must still believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are stor@@ my , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which first shows itself on stage - in view of the great heat in casual casual clothing .
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors had been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
in 2013 , he had to have a whi@@ st@@ led pipe concert about himself , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the occasional &quot; boys &quot; cri@@ es were under@@ going .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa .
the public did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive summary .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to go ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are 26 years now , a late @-@ appointed volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I did finish .
and then a civil engineering degree , we say , successfully broke off .
for me , I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne make a social worker education and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you make your FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
in other words than in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about counting extras .
there are always other people who have a different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the type for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is the same .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and sh@@ orten their interim dividend by 72 percent as a further restructuring program will be started in order to overcome the pressures the company faces .
the job cuts , the general director John Fall@@ on , announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partners Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the capital of Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and one interpre@@ ter were injured , an explanation of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the US military hospital at the Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the T@@ ali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the T@@ ali@@ ban said they carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ bing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country &apos;s dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack since the US @-@ led troops pushed the T@@ ali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and the police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by compl@@ ying
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states compl@@ ained of the agency because of the stri@@ de .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Conditions 2015 , &quot; and said that it is showing the Agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the O@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in some of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter standards of air quality in order to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with Colombia &apos;s district , filed a complaint on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have caused the demo@@ crats and nature protection groups to worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website states that breathing air , which contains o@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and improve respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ o win@@ els decides the establishment of a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although the church community is still owned by the church community , it will still take a while , but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be constructed by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council stipul@@ ate that such a common space is not intended as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but openly into the community .
as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the running budget last autumn , will be made by grants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , supporting 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed proposal is to indicate the investor that he does not want to t@@ opp@@ le the legs between the legs in this regard , the statement that both artic@@ ulated - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces the lift height and makes the construction more economical - possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer thinks it is this addi@@ tive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not that easy in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Ruf refers to the many buildings that are not quite prec@@ eded by the fact that they are now coming out of the window in the common room , they say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is sure to speak out for the common room - but absolutely against a community involvement .
it sees behind it an conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to any of the wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value , which is market@@ able in doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents for Sta@@ zione &apos;s motion to request the proposed resolution accordingly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that sums up Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coll@@ ision by car : cycl@@ ist is thrown on the road
on the crossing of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and was seriously injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way out of direction Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the street , he obviously didn &apos;t look at the counter @-@ traffic .
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern München does not have to miss the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel , FC Bayern travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven pro@@ s lack the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , personnel will always take care of the German football record champion Bayern München .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without the BV@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
the Mün@@ ch@@ horns Manuel Neuer , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , that was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official pr@@ el@@ ude of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intensive game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the duo of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
walk in the resin of Stern to Stern
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nation@@ wide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; coming to meet the need for information of many resin @-@ go@@ ers was called it .
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to place tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations in five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be comple@@ mented by the Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of s@@ iting regions .
accessibility is also a criteri@@ on .
later , the star path will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the society explained .
they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is stronger than another , although it would be far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star is found and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association operates in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the closest observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the middle of the Harz Mountains is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with bare eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the planet &apos;s path .
starting before Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Glei@@ chen ) with the Planet of Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to being degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun &apos;s exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centi@@ meters .
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
during the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting pit combat in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the ailing World Boxing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko to welcome the World Boxing Club super @-@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ com@@ missions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia kno@@ cked out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 o &apos;clock in ES@@ PN .
when the pair was pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former weight of suspension , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got up for Bron@@ ths &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down on lightweight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he must move on lightweight weigh@@ ted &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this struggle . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23rd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later op@@ press to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he finds Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side is very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stroke strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries to tire placement
in an accident on the A7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 o &apos;clock shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right to the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof of the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first care of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in the direction of the north for about one hour , followed by the traffic on the left road@@ strip at the accident site .
Fort@@ una Hoffmann : &quot; the chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 to start the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that optimi@@ zing the defense formation in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first game of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , either because of the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ chain is also to be optimized further .
and the Fort@@ une doesn &apos;t want to catch a gate after a breach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will get better after the experience in preparing the three @-@ chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequis@@ ite is that we harmon@@ ise even better and we don &apos;t have so many ab@@ usive mistakes in setting up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann will also go to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak about a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good start of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of this his trainer wanted to know nothing .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , guests from the Rhin@@ eland are as easy favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them , just because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to hit from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ una &apos;s top coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish asylum @-@ age assessment tests
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who have under@@ gone a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish agency for For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the app@@ rais@@ al of age during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are consistent with the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of past months , the figures are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in The Local Magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases suggest@@ ing that the investigated person was 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , when x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of men to see if they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t safely say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of evalu@@ ating a child as an adult is small .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Public Transportation and Transport in the Government Pres@@ idency Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the works began at the same time on all three refurb@@ ishment @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurb@@ ished .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted so @-@ called bridge board .
this is a marginal fix@@ ation , which is also used as an operating lane .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is to take place .
the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ z@@ wo .
the other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented bridge caps .
particular touch @-@ ti@@ ghtening sensation has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
in the run @-@ up to the work , the residents were informed of the project by hand@@ outs .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs had to be removed .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting area towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated single @-@ lane by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach place entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed .
the costs for the three bridge constructions amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise only difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties represented in the Circle of Culture ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows peaceful colours on that day , because the Af@@ D invites its &quot; big election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell .
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; is planned on the well site , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ale - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police have ordered a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence , especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ D volcan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to get such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because there were not enough parking places due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at 8@@ pm , a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz takes care of various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ Chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and Deputy Prime Minister Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
something more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is short after 9@@ pm to clean up .
the police can back - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher tromb@@ one player Freder@@ ic B@@ elli can be heard in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konzer@@ te tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets a classical German apprentices@@ hip with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have played solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo tromb@@ one of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of different gen@@ res .
this is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; by the jazz driver N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free playing blend into a fascinating total art work .
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its particular acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is very open about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite the grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately became bitter .
in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette performer agre@@ es to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; -@@ magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with anyone I was reading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she especially suffered under &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school when she rather dressed like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of yourself ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain her love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some refer to me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats got away from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal trading from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said , &quot; The change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party who would hin@@ der us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia on a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he reiter@@ ated that it was not the moment for the country to return to sport again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader , D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ in , said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were caught in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress approved the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to rep@@ orters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized for themselves that it has experienced some rather hot times and will do all possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything over the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Athletics Championships , which start on Friday in London to compete for the rig@@ orous IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he told rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council .
soldiers F@@ uner@@ al in Mali St@@ ressed Sol@@ di@@ ers
during a funeral service in F@@ ritz@@ lar , north h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers were thought of by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister for Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the un@@ resolved cause of the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two revers@@ ed pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Northern Germany died a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar Cathedral Saint Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the sad@@ ness of the mour@@ ning was lying down , the relatives were in arm in arm to the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defense from the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
no doubt about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was the case with the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband , and she said further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , he was still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Fe@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik had not received the title and function in Denmark , which he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the principal speaker of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French emb@@ assy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew off , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year @-@ old reign .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik commented on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for hope .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wishes to re @-@ election swi@@ ft@@ ly
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
the Minister @-@ President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the resolution of the parliament spoke out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their State Parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen combined its step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she announced on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U group leader Björ@@ n Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to take it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , CD@@ U and F@@ DP together had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected for the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the red @-@ green state government must now decide if it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , however , is indispensable for the fact that the day of the parliament resol@@ ves as quickly as possible its self @-@ liqui@@ dation .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state Constitution also provides the possibility that the country &apos;s day draws confidence from the Prime Minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; summar@@ ize called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself emphasized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a bear@@ er of black @-@ green .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called on the stub@@ born de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we , of course , assume that she returned to her country @-@ day mandate , which she received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the chair@@ men Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the German Social @-@ Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony shares this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxins , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses on contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal occur ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) and answers .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg bat@@ ches .
the affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture .
food monitoring is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has switched on without delay and since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all information and risk assessment are available for consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade , as well as the manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are transport @-@ proof and harmless to health .
if the residual sugar content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not capable of transport .
however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , production companies do not bear any immediate fault .
on the contrary , they must expect economic damages due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too little controllers in case of emergency .
is it lacking only at the staff or on the concl@@ usive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent ruled out .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent enlighten@@ ment of such events and hand@@ ing over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal crimes can be present are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made clear that I expect a complete enlighten@@ ment by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ arms in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and competitive foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are entitled to rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by means of arm@@ oured funding , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation which is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food@@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be elu@@ ci@@ dated and complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football affect Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of the European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access@@ ing the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play Rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that at some point PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ y@@ mar was funded without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can easily make money in order for Ne@@ y@@ mar to sign and bring him to a galax@@ y of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the power @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but they have to interact with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , the UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off excessive expenses .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will surely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ y@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years in the amount of 44.@@ 4 million euros can be exp@@ elled at the end of the year .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will remain on 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might attempt to out@@ source their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ an enterprise could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments from the 2022 World Cup Committee of Organ@@ izing Committee .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 denied that Ne@@ y@@ mar Cup ambassador will be ambassador and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A did not have prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with sales of EUR 54@@ 2.4 million has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier supplier
Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss Life in recent years .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline does not write the order again .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott endor@@ sed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; on request by the news agency .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packaged tablets of 14 gram divide the flight atten@@ d@@ ants prior to landing to passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the cost .
business insi@@ ders estimate the order volume in accordance with &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new ten@@ dering .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss since 2006 has been distribut@@ ing chocolate boards on board their flights .
before the Swiss completed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo was two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
for long @-@ hau@@ l flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Sp@@ rün@@ gli , in the Business Class sn@@ are passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this re@@ petition of history is nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ he @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge era ( when the vision@@ aries David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter turned the Sk@@ et@@ ch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like the time is tight .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - they still managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ ody goes beyond the casting know principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that ro@@ ls the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character promp@@ ts through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the charming C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy evil plot involved in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ spoken impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt Dill@@ ons sub@@ li@@ ces of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old h@@ acker .
it &apos;s the moments of random del@@ usions that could inv@@ oke this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
meanwhile , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon rec@@ alls a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LOW &quot; with its east @-@ west ring @-@ combat icon@@ ography .
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , gives the director a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a comprehensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
in six long epis@@ odes it moves away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was reduced to a lesser extent , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef are always visiting the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that the Western culture can make all the food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian authors did not lie wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor Con@@ stance announced on Friday .
in doing so , 15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials granted greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
during the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crime , severe violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany has been determined .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
as a result of the investigations , the Italian nationals were mainly related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the German Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out large gaps in the country centre register .
defici@@ encies in the data registered there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and dep@@ ort@@ ations , in a manner in which the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; is present .
according to the figures , ten million people with foreign nationality have been registered in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in some cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can slow reverse processes significantly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on people who pay for travel , EU citizens are also included , who wouldn &apos;t have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such incorrect assignments resulted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate about dealing with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently started sending back refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to this paper , it is said that BA@@ MF takes such methods &quot; relating to families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the paper referred to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also return refugees to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ g@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system of illegal admission conditions and a threat to the child &apos;s welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already donated blood donation to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ul , who now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknowle@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is awesome how our body is designed for it and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the county manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry counted among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .

the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish as it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members in this month to increase , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary in order to raise the inflation @-@ heated inflation and she said that the cost of credit might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut economic package , which was issued after the Bre@@ x@@ it a year ago .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks starting February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households remains deb@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the interest rates they reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain ti@@ ghtening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; extent than the markets await .
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank , however , stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; .
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts revised upwards for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the increasing expectations for an interest increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the ti@@ ghtening becomes even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that the wages will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after cutting interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the sound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final ruling on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said the excess in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for stores and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will receive a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the N@@ HS drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre@@ ex@@ positioning pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which could reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , are now delivered by health care for a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed that last year the Supreme Court ruled that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to permit registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medications are present in a person &apos;s body to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours prior to intercourse .
to those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable candidates will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on how to use it on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ hau@@ l the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a transaction with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warm@@ ly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow minister of health , said : &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us to step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living a great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , sc@@ aled down in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne &apos;s terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t pack her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne &apos;s closet space and an mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 @-@ foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate level in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so they were stack@@ ed over one another without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge mou@@ fl@@ es lighting the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , room and light .
at both ends a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to let it work longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real estate agent will enter a ru@@ di@@ mentary form and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical plug sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from slightly more standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate imperi@@ um
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confron@@ tation because of one of the biggest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and Develop@@ er Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis res@@ ides in a mansion in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp contro@@ vers@@ y over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the family founded West@@ co je@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 to $ 85 million .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in , described by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 316 million and Paul holds USD 176 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press releases suggested by Col@@ in have left him with what I considered for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hear@@ ings of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
they used the security to purchase the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first je@@ ans .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has beha@@ ved very much , even though he was a former member of the AF@@ L board and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the television star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and put our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father didn &apos;t want Paul and me to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump@@ et new chief of staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met at his first working day with leading employees , he represented a major issue in President Donald Tr@@ ump@@ le &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information coming into the president &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair report from places to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep the Twitter habit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign groups know something that we don &apos;t know to others - that Tr@@ ump@@ ets twe@@ ets without their interventions would have included even more ignition .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump did not send .
if his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently avoided that tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y ev@@ okes .
part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may foster their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt .
this was an example described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he is trying to find out where they come from .
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mal@@ ici@@ ously gave a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that in the past he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher also added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , who negoti@@ ated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ av@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transp@@ orts after they were first thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry people have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , saying that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it as he was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved on and are now back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers just to be lo@@ oted from another round .
the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised bearing on the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birk@@ enhof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birk@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , about 30,000 nights per year were lost and revenues by the local tax were also lost .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation in the district office building , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placement of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the Council of Commun@@ ism .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious interested people in the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Birk@@ enhof has been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old baths removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nicely bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room are part of the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer stresses .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify precisely .
he reck@@ ons just under one million euros .
the outer plants are also brought forward , this is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ ers Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee has received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to persons familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller wi@@ dened and intensi@@ fied his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ c@@ aster reported that there were already first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time , specifically in the presidential elections in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump@@ et Ele@@ ction Team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , there are several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more tr@@ umps in the private and business environment .
the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special promot@@ er Tr@@ ump personally stepped into the centre and for@@ ked the accus@@ ation whether the president may hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to examine the present evidence in possible crime scenes and decide whether prosecution should be raised .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore called anchor chambers .
mostly they are switched on when these are larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office to charge individuals with an oath .
according to the CN@@ N broad@@ c@@ aster , pre @-@ loads were already issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who participated in the meeting were called upon to testify , it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were also involved in the interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting @-@ up show that Mu@@ eller did not leave his work in@@ timi@@ dating and that if necessary he wanted to act fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury would end up in order to decide on the charge of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the demo@@ crats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury .
he also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that accelerated the work of the special promot@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey told me three times that not against the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to believe that something has changed in this statement , it was said in the Declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this rape , alle@@ g@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become lou@@ der , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said before a Senate committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him to stop the investigations against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
after representing US media , the White House collected material against the special promot@@ er and his staff .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to be released .
unlike an independent medi@@ ator of the Congress , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later rec@@ ci@@ ated President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the urge of the president of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft laws on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dism@@ issed as easily .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the scar@@ ce seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the ice shelf .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tril@@ lion of tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 km and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
a danger for people does not eman@@ ate from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg , according to research information is uncertain .
in total , however , for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a factor background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the tip of the ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the po@@ ise of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions several years ago .
a complete scra@@ pie is broken down there , writes A@@ WI researchers Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is in danger , as the front edge has never been with@@ drawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can crum@@ ble if a piece breaks in a key place .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ b and Eis@@ berg doesn &apos;t increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting .
however , the loss of the ice age causes the glacier to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project for observation of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) writes .
according to A@@ WI information , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is the fourth @-@ largest shelf of Ant@@ arc@@ tic with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf will grow back or go back over the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers did not trace the demo@@ li@@ tion of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , however , in the past few decades , many of the Eis@@ schel@@ str@@ e of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula have fallen apart .
this long tip of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic stretches towards South America .
according to the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the drop in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has been war@@ med by about three degrees in the last 50 years and is thus one of the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U asks you to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the day of the circle has reached 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the M@@ ett@@ mann district administration .
now 17 tra@@ inees have their first working day .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
approximately 620 entries were recorded for the places to be missed this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in M@@ ett@@ mann district .
they are sought by doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term demand for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented evaluation of applications .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and extern@@ ally , showing concrete measures for trans@@ verse entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public employer competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a high number of employees who leave the service for disease or age reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high time for action so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had long been worried about a la@@ zy surprise already in the day of the circle , when he questioned the costs of personnel costs and the other parties amazed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow an exit from the local employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the county government should strive for a house tari@@ ff , perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U is trying to pay better for employees and officials when there is a public service charge .
the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least because of the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , coun@@ cil@@ ors Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the tone of NGO migrants emergency boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had effectively collabor@@ ated with human hands in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the detailed plans of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o &apos;s Italian prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are so sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation said in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is thought that its crew takes ding@@ hy @-@ migrants , which are delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can sail so that the vessels can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor &apos;s Act , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of going beyond the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have , above all , an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring about &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign up , Nobel prize @-@ winner @-@ organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest riders met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival at Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream layers .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long trials p@@ opp@@ y .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest saus@@ age market .
again the look@@ out point to the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ w@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days , many metres of altitude have been announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers offered healing br@@ ine at the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 al@@ timet@@ ers , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium lawn during wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , a lu@@ cra@@ tive business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high tonn@@ ages included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also recognized the first federal grants to become increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the Stuttgart V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Managing Director Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are still some clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Federation ( FIFA World Cup ) organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .

Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual soccer players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the federal government to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even FIFA @-@ based simulation FIFA will be challenged at a competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since established itself in which the professionals compete against each other .
and e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme in the Asian games 2022 .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ar also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and presents many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fi@@ st@@ as also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
controls were difficult to carry out on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientist empha@@ sizes the high integ@@ rative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are traveling internationally , this is like a large global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband ( Interactive ) entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts the e @-@ sport of rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
sales are expected to be 130 million in three years .
that is little against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the way .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
a lot of things are happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a teaching subject , she says rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , the German soccer league clubs , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is not enough today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time equi@@ pping the company on the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t stick to the fact that everything remains as it was always in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter is sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachus@@ etts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , 20 years old , will spend 15 months of sent@@ encing behind bars and spent five years on prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free up to his vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter was standing with tears in her eyes , folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not ren@@ ounce the loss of my beloved Son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testi@@ fied that she was &quot; followed by the recognition &quot; that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or that she would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person I have been with since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachus@@ etts which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that it would benefit from the fall by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mir : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ che was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern tr@@ umps a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation is not hur@@ ting there .
something was different to his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ che immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer was to be seen , he made the band@@ age allocated to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first assignment as Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the coach could interpret it in the same way .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al had been chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had just come from the holidays , but he did .
sugar is distributed especially to those who have a lot of tru@@ ste@@ es to keep you in a mood .
those who were chosen to enter the inheritance of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ pped over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
to the right rear , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did its rest .
and at all , Kim@@ mir was in this initial formation as the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the in@@ compatible tro@@ upe .
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy with himself .
in order for Vid@@ al to over@@ play his lack of fitness ( fol@@ ks barely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come out to join the services of the Asia trip ( also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not neg@@ atively fall into their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ tri@@ cot .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ mir , Rud@@ y in front of the def@@ enses , both acted more confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times successfully in the game building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance when making his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked at the game afterwards .
Rud@@ y , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mir sha@@ ves for a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one anymore .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it often became irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Utility Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around of the city is natural in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 will be the building right .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Hop@@ ing of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the goal is to put the circuit into operation in December 2020 , says Council spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a guide to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier , like Wis@@ sing , aims to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees in the new Master @-@ Bonus , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 euros is provided for the passed championship examination and 2500 Euro , if graduates in ten years after the master training make themselves independent .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction requires quick facts , but at the same time there is no need for the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier .
so far , 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire bis@@ sing in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bald@@ auf , CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , points to the calculations of the account , the country is investing more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the hitherto broad@@ band expansion in the country was so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the rating 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stag@@ gering internet connections and break@@ down@@ s .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke on April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it cleared the field again after four months because of in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies .
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the president of the BMW Group said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as call@@ ers .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install exhaust gases from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of p@@ aving the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be placed in the United States in court .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer has disp@@ ropor@@ tion@@ ately contributed to the win of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar visitors participate , a raft ride through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
if you go back to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building bure@@ au wants to clear up .
on the raft you see a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should shar@@ pen as a protective wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los B@@ ases and laughter against sorrow
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the no@@ ose @-@ nos@@ es of his figures are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he became an artist , among other things , as an illustr@@ ator for congrat@@ ulation cards - which fru@@ strated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again , the artist let himself be inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o characters cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still on the table today , working almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks , his cute figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide .
he has been working on a carto@@ on and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack of thousands as a counter@@ part .
for the first time his characters speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced in a word @-@ like manner .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and due to the diseases , which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , are causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agri@@ cultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to climate change , which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only attra@@ cting tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ ise said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 th anniversary this year .

assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the workers of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they have been told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists will discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office that was the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the premis@@ e : enemies , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings suff@@ ice .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no retirement from violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspir@@ er by Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , showing his smile with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special federal prosec@@ utor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ itor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit for discussing security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we all mi@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums of drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed gang@@ lion bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper published in the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the toxic@@ ity problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courage@@ ous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
rep@@ orters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever she was leading .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the sp@@ a@@ ß@@ bird , who could cur@@ ses like a do@@ ck@@ workers , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and counsel , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
now they ask , Was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
his death also forced her to question her own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do their job best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret laun@@ chers and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells wron@@ g@@ ly , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing is going to happen with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cra@@ tive sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room in which the workers from Ri@@ odo@@ ce met safety training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed . days before it was known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were mand@@ ated by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , who were not trust@@ worthy by the Gover@@ nor himself .
it is months since the rep@@ orters passed into the mountain landscape , where the gang of drugs de fac@@ to are under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has cli@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former well @-@ known cabinet Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a pos@@ é on state expenditure focused on the hom@@ etown of the governor .
and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Public Prosecutor , which carried out a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or what happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost the whole century on all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have seen the Val@@ dez column as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we would have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of a further journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists all over the country have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on foot@@ paths and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has since asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , the government officials involved and an in@@ different society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the front page title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , admitted that the drug trade scar@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to Hell , and that &apos;s why I was rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones started bu@@ zz@@ ing .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ val@@ es and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan Resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of cart@@ els emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the ker@@ b edge you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez designed a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mining worker have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
the report in the journal Current Bi@@ ology described it as &quot; the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved state has aston@@ ished researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the arm@@ oured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he du@@ g on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he hit something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 l@@ b. ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy ground cl@@ umping .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only blin@@ win@@ kle with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ coating , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ed@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours covering it carefully .
the astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ado@@ wing is common , the results are surprising because the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today .
there is evidence that the din@@ osau@@ r has been hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confron@@ tation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r shows how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on po@@ inters on its life , including its preserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as its final meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as Süd@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and preser@@ ves the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use a lot of imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Peri@@ od was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he du@@ g on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the padded din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ced from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater refund of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the cr@@ ates of the house still cover b@@ oll@@ us@@ ky arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as winning a lot@@ to .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &quot;
thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ er@@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , around 5.00 p.m. between the junction locations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed .
the exact number of the wounded leaves no information at first .
it was light to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said .
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten kilometer long tail@@ gate was formed .
as reported as a AZ rep@@ orter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade fast@@ ened the hall@@ marks of the vehicle electri@@ cians , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car driver and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing beats the train and sleeps .
or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an uns@@ us@@ p@@ ected or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
timet@@ able control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control system .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the name of the railway timet@@ able without conductor .
to use this , however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
it is also necessary to have access to the DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : you step into the train , call your ticket at &quot; My Rates . &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation is then published with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and taken the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ d@@ ant arrives at the passenger ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket already used .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail@@ ways - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without any ticket control by our train atten@@ d@@ ant check in the DB Navig@@ ator themselves .
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing executive vice @-@ president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tions are among the greatest off@@ ences .
because often you have , in any case , one of the co @-@ travelers not all the documents you need for de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the ID card or any other document that you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that only applies to the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; whose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ eted on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ et the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s le@@ blo@@ o@@ em body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of the police tape and people scre@@ aming , and by a man claiming to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a shield with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman released his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l rec@@ alled their testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and power , strength and resistance , which consists of the view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a cau@@ li@@ flower and a fitting crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had &quot; countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only ac@@ tivis@@ m and organization , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to get rid of ourselves .
even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience a bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place facing the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of ac@@ tivis@@ m began to accept for Fer@@ rel@@ l figure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my ac@@ tivis@@ m totally changed after 9th August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted to document what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his ac@@ tivis@@ m around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt @-@ Ins@@ assen .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me how these people are portra@@ yed , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ r@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ r@@ ells life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ r@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of black teen@@ age Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the foref@@ ront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman stands so much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , even though it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct collap@@ ses the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
the subject can hardly be found cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while some say a bit @-@ gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ dest ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , including the rest of the business , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery will be planned exactly on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market hall is located , in which 13 direct markets offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work it will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a @-@ plaz@@ a with possibility to sit outside .
Simone rooms : &quot; for many years we have been shopping for almost every week in the farmer &apos;s market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land women are very happy again and again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like to see that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery will depend on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low with the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why buy a grocery store in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
of this , there are already enough in our city .
you see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not yet another weekly market , it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often not portable to a retail@@ er .
too bad , special business is almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery really comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ghost bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , to drive all the stores of Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping centre empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my view it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place .
when the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room at the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging from the ceiling on cables .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ sw@@ abs and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former Intelligence Analy@@ st ban@@ ished a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after publicly announced diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing , has created a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger V@@ isions &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ t and che@@ wing gum by extra@@ cting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing as she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ efs that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ orted Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would convert Chel@@ ant &apos;s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
the fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , would ask Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome form of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump carries a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ rable ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid spl@@ its he was supposed to fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen to happen for a specific reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is endo@@ wed with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frac@@ turing , the foundation of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people hope to take with them is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ an Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned Com@@ ic Nov@@ elle .
it shows Mann@@ ing as she shows up with a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of the United States &quot; disciplinary arc@@ ades like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they let down your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted him from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res that gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , right up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg told the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Oxford and an employee of Oxford University for K@@ illing
a nation@@ wide human race is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ ts arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the County Court of Cook County .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ul , the vice president for university relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them should now be certified and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal responsibility examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cub@@ icle said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and wanting he turned out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly requested the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a notion of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious hint that said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as being very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team has issued an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code describing the criteria for the re @-@ entry of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause Russia to worry about Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities will have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in the Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not give anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one is afraid to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rus@@ ada was exp@@ elled in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of the WA@@ DA by the execution of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli stated that Rus@@ ada moved &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , to provide specific groups and demographic groups , to address employees anony@@ m@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won .
in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comforts and which leaders have low approval outcomes - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies are coming to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als , since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cra@@ tive business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial engineering site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent Enterprise can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the head of the business is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ved un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover , and law@@ suits , said Quin@@ lan .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent applies , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or unfair practice - can be identified quicker and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 when the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , quin@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors , who supported both start @-@ ups .
in February , Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million for financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee involvement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough or not at all , this can prompt dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow your colleagues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated employees , they were able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to better bon@@ ding of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you will also lose customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customer then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A sol@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training areas of the team on the campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 AM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and they actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed time sched@@ ules of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they added another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on her three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ate themselves further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will finish its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Fun Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been ki@@ cked off with foot@@ b@@ äl@@ len , which is a safety net behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task .
fry players are said to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to factor sur@@ vey@@ ors that may indicate results of the fact check from the original article .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French vot@@ ers floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be pun@@ ish@@ able after the social media networks if it fails to quickly remove hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new Fac@@ ts Review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fact sur@@ vey@@ ors are being challenged by third parties , people want more context in order to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and work on other changes in its news feed to reduce false news .
creation of a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ opol@@ itan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a predi@@ le@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also involved .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who has been beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest , I have over@@ rated my welcome note ) it all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled hy@@ dra@@ tion heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ches .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with pat@@ rons , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last bay , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
guys , let everything go their way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revol@@ t of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant revol@@ t started in this area and I thought it was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe they are connected with each other ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l portra@@ yed his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in filled with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was du@@ g out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite fe@@ eb@@ le , repeatedly making debts and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men rede@@ emed their school debt by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se Er@@ within . &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ ä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ah , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Camp@@ aig@@ n started : over 300 years old lad@@ ra chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf sh@@ rou@@ ded
with the v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched their campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
even until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan home to Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August , it is said to be a highlight of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens know very well about the beauty and attra@@ c@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the action it is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she was competing with other local authorities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and campaign .
Turkey &apos;s military reforms - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es in Ankara on pensions and promotions in officers &quot; cor@@ ps .
so this week .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building , just as before , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
under the head of the head of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the consult@@ ations .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ count .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the Commander of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dism@@ issed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt .
against 48@@ 6 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negoti@@ ating in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup d &quot; é@@ tat as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
as a general staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifest@@ ed itself in the lifting of the prohibition of head@@ scarf for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the case with the army and the security forces goes on in any case .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was de@@ voting more 73@@ 95 servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times , they put@@ ted their role as a guar@@ dian of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan re@@ pressed the power of the military step by step , not least with regard to the reform specifications of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO chil@@ ly .
in any case , in the alliance with the pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the readiness to use the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining visa for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries will issue Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , c@@ ited by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for race track
over the past few months over the future of the competition sh@@ utt@@ les has been fought over and over again - now it &apos;s supposed to go very quickly .
before the end of the year it is supposed to be built on the steep stretch of the tourist rail .
in order to secure the future of the competition sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the route will begin this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ i@@ tise the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is particularly related to tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track were estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ takes 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as operators have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested , whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ ump@@ y .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t be even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we have to start taking their asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver lots of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern doll@@ s have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the robotic eye color to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes even more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a st@@ eppe @-@ woman look progressive .
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ters have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing like sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , giving the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ missive female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : relu@@ ct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah is concerned , trouble a most .
on his site True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy distributed with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men have any Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toys .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R not@@ ices their growing popularity , they remain temporary at the edge of consumer culture .
but what is perme@@ ated from the boundary conditions can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has been bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) is not the graphical images , the intri@@ cate body and the en@@ och@@ oned eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realis@@ tically as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ly that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ ages , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companions .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the 2017 phrase : maid
Tr@@ ump@@ ets Big Performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that the U.S. vot@@ ers have pol@@ arized also divided families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all rig@@ or@@ ously trying to make our filter bags burst .
less has been noted is the power of Tr@@ ump@@ et to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ le@@ aning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone who knows it , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades on account of politics suddenly and quite stran@@ gely on the same page .
for the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but I notice that this also involves considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ elled .
there is , however , an even more terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right wing , &quot; which suddenly seem to be the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
today I find myself affected by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ ari@@ ous version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to a very mild off@@ ense .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are cre@@ aky and the animals twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ atic music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are getting old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go to it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced in a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing gr@@ ins@@ ing while I we@@ ari@@ ed the experience to submit my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pains moved from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
in the past year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , which according to the prison authorities suffered a fall in his cell .
due to the murder of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , of which they say they are too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National prosecution authority said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äs@@ sler from F@@ üt@@ zen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the dism@@ iss@@ al students go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of the dism@@ iss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes voted by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle that grows up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
in addition , the m@@ ess Sch@@ ar conducted a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it bro@@ ods from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken k@@ ens a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that , classes three and four showed a hen &apos;s dance in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young sho@@ vels , who wore the cylinders to the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished for every four @-@ t@@ eller that he felt accepted in his new school .
it followed thanks to the colleagues , former head of school Michael Müller , who always jumps back in teaching passes , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the kitchen time is over now , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she won &apos;t leave her students very relu@@ ct@@ ant , because it had been a really great time .
finally she was able to rely on the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äs@@ sler .
at the end all students heard a song of summer time and holiday time .
with the children , great joy arose .
eight first @-@ players are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited by television .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally celebrated people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have ti@@ ghtened control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve exhaust emissions of Euro 5 and some Euro 6 emissions categories .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates handled are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have the software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation within the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to address any affected person .
if an inspection is required anyway , that will be done in their framework .
how long should the conversion work be drawn altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the hangs from the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group do ?
the ACE advis@@ es to wait .
presum@@ ably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there has been no value losses for older diesel until now .

we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will be in R@@ ente next year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a city super@@ visor for 31 years .
and the work always makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in press conversation .
he reports from varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
in this way - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision to be done .
since Has@@ lach has acted as Lower Building Law Authority for the Board of Directors , the applicant must show appropriate statements .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they would no longer be able to fill them out , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction department and his employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park@@ place are about to be encountered .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , including the stadium renovation is still subject matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will come to terms with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker believes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
there is a large play area for a city building master .
thanks to Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s own building yard and nur@@ sery , it is possible to react flexi@@ bly to versatility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble under historic preservation , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the former mayor empha@@ sizes .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high degree of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years .
W@@ acker wishes his successor for a long time too : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , according to the town of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed degree in engineering or a bach@@ elor with a specialist in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law .
the Municipal Building Department is subject to civil and civil engineering , construction planning , real estate matters , urban properties management , urban farm with building yard and urban gar@@ dening , as well as lower building rights authority including monument protection .
bicycle drawn on lines : South rail track locked
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track super@@ se@@ duction in the area of Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpet@@ rators and are looking for them since the night .
close to the crime scene a ros@@ ary roller and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ster , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch zur AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators , would have put themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ arc and the costs for rail transport traffic , there could also be p@@ ön@@ alen from the railway customers to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south side track could be led without any disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were off for Friday morning , two of which were related to the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains were not falling , but they had delay .
according to the Ö@@ BB Spe@@ aker Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meter overhead lines had to be replaced .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food cannot penetrate the body .
cells capable of trig@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance goes too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a type of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote a more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el movement when the same system will also work with people .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan exam@@ ines a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was divided apart , had not had this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then translated small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an in@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the fo@@ dder of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tra@@ cts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells steer inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can potentially lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Manchester United signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound in@@ scription of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last low season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid ki@@ cked off on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched on as they like .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which gave Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be prepared sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beside M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that Mo@@ ur@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three out of four , for that I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state of Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the radar shield was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
nothing but a fire from the central party , but no head@@ wind from the League , was the most important wish of the election milit@@ ants .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House employees are observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not have been described in the approach with head@@ wind .
it was ra@@ inf@@ all .
and one by one .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green cannot reliably rule , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising Group president of a Green Party de@@ pl@@ ored the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Lower Saxony Green Party El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transfer to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the electoral welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen has to return her mandate immediately , &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election champion sigh@@ ed , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reached party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the pro@@ visional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD country associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades at that time cal@@ med down .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that was also - and everything got much worse .
the SPD defeat brought the SPD in exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy smooth@@ ed the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ging back in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next grav@@ ure .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD country squ@@ ad , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in the communication of the crisis it was almost everything that could be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fought for political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time .
hypoth@@ eses were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l always tried to acc@@ entu@@ ate in recent weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised to stabili@@ ze the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time , Wei@@ l finds no fault with the party @-@ internal force of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the back@@ sliding parliament@@ arians in the West .
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen put their own career on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person , but on the regional list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in the Parliament , so the Lower Saxony member continues .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liament@@ ary Group , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vot@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a candidate for the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career gifts of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there was more or there was further commitments made by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for city center III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years can get support from the country soon .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ST@@ EG urban development informed on Wednesday in emotion .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what was happening .
since 1991 , there have been in feelings san@@ itation areas .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III .
the funding amount was 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest from the church senti@@ ments .
how is a remedi@@ ation area now being developed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to examine so Sch@@ in@@ dler where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the area limits may also be postpon@@ ed .
on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EG represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the refur@@ bish@@ ments would then be carried out .
the core of the program is revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions , and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the rehabilitation area would then eventually be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026 .
however , until September this year , the stock survey would only be carried out in the framework of those involved in filling out a questionn@@ aire for the participants in the rehabilitation field .
in November or December , the order of the statutes is to be carried out in the shortest possible time , so that in the coming year it is possible to start renov@@ ations .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that every municipality must carry out the said preliminary investigations .
it is about ass@@ essing the situation of urban development and to decide when to san@@ i@@ tise and to what extent .
there is also a san@@ itation note in the register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back again and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
therefore , questionn@@ aires will be sent that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; Building and Property Sheet &quot; in which it works , among other things , about the structural condition and renovation views .
in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing sheet , &quot; information on size , division and inhabitants of a residential space can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out when operating in the building premises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new building measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve to support .
Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of the funding is working according to the &apos; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &apos; - who comes first , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes .
you cannot reserve funds for later .
at the end , photos of the project &quot; Location II &quot; were shown to make the participants a &quot; tasty . &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory group of an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologists in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the helm .
white House advertising costs will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises the American production last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military supplies that have been left to the TIME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the helicopter was built in Connec@@ tic@@ ut .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy nav@@ al commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message indicated that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and remained so long until the tur@@ f was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the flight departure from the White House would be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a breach of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to the reform of the health reform going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically beneficial purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but the use of only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often conduct training flights in the Washington area and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the US President at the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 training land@@ ings in the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted during the training needs of the crew for the month , said an official .
helicop@@ ters flew an additional 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential campaign missions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Sik@@ or@@ sky spokesperson said that the company hadn &apos;t been involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ary records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for re@@ funds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study of 2015 , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present these week things produced in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it .
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump had inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump talked to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and talked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss a tri@@ cky job
the leading edge of the Second World Tennis League ki@@ cks off at the S@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow at 11 : 00 a.m. in Kiel near the S@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV .
in spite of five games still fla@@ w@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League won the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent at any rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the post@@ erior positions I find the crew very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the SV @-@ dor@@ fer SV , the imports from the high north are above all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Fin@@ n can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ la@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s getting heavy for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man not currently active at the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in the Italian Bi@@ ella team does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec is at his first bet in this season .
the previously un@@ conquered Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Belarus An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should also be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niels Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ ag@@ n@@ ina .
after his two vic@@ tories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again be brought back to the team .
enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the juni@@ ors world ranking in January 2016 , does not fill up the cad@@ re from the train station around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law on Wednesday evening under the law of ti@@ ghtening sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming against the US offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors in the hom@@ ey O@@ MV are concerned , who together with other European firms have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership ( Nord Stream 2 ) .
the threat is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Season 3 Trailer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be the hub of the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series has not been over for a long time .
the Staff@@ s three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the newest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 Company , &quot; only with more state bri@@ ber@@ ies and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) , who commands the Mexican compound , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ co will start on September 1st .
reverse : the town presents 46 kitchen aids .
the town organiz@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s day care centers the clock is turned back .
on 1 September Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gart@@ ens ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
it continues to cook outside the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh gas bills .
the town runs 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
last year &apos;s kit@@ ten year , 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 week@@ days are in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour supervision if children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time workers have kitchen service from 1 September onwards : they warm up the delivered foods , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give away food , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as seven units - decides the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen staff now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why it is all about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the chi@@ ck@@ wave power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen power , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison for the city as the most economical one , it is from the Press Office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are rest@@ art@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for around 750 people in the educational area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , offici@@ ating director of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ elled in the coun@@ cils in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s role cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
the T@@ ali@@ ban has released threats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition of international combat actions to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democra@@ tically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3.6 million vot@@ ers .

two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police information , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 pm , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpet@@ rators tried to attack the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which however failed .
without prey the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union wants to make sure about the long @-@ term commitment to production at its work in Glas@@ gow at managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces hob@@ by@@ ists and rich tea bis@@ cuits beside other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; raise concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glas@@ gow region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urgently a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly review our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned of Ne@@ y@@ mar three years ago ?
La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon Ne@@ y@@ mar &apos;s persecution after leaving an offer of £ 189 million to release his release cl@@ ause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record assault ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned last season to Manchester United for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , Ne@@ y@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring near the Catal@@ an board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City held an interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best PS@@ G players .
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ i@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , it will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Ne@@ y@@ mar .

the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car came to meet him on his lane , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and touched the guard .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au coming to Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver touched the guard as well .

it would be useful to the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were measured in reporting about violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the interference in Regensburg no one doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis also commented in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church and that &apos;s a dev@@ oured Fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schl@@ atings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been a normal ped@@ agog@@ ical tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with nau@@ gh@@ ty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to past decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often also appeared .
completely wron@@ g@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take George R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment At@@ tor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of assault , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexual abuse .
in the final report it is written about Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be noted that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially at high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accus@@ ations , many victims over@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even associate positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has reli@@ ed on his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence in protective guards at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a conf@@ lic@@ ting image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
for one , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became hand@@ gri@@ eved by the eye if there was no musical top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all there .
he is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exemp@@ ted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool occurred outside of his sphere of influence .
it is possible to repro@@ ach him at best , to know too late or to have taken the first hints seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all sur@@ vey@@ ors as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also testi@@ fies to an excellent record , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to wound out@@ breaks .
the fact that he did not only kno@@ ck with chairs and threw the key on the ground , but also sw@@ ayed the sla@@ p and too nau@@ gh@@ ty guys on the hair or ears , he himself acknowledged , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in question@@ able time , 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a secular school , a gramm@@ ar school .
in comparison with what it &apos;s all about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders if it is not more of his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
the media reported much about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen in connection with the report .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put some involvement or complic@@ ity with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to be entrusted with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even commit themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a well @-@ asked disciple put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... there is no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely findings and could have hal@@ ted the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that b@@ askets are imp@@ en@@ et@@ rable or clear@@ er or even more open than towards their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust@@ worthy teachers , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that one talks about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any complic@@ ity .
in this way , it cannot be accused of preventing or having brought it to light .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; looking away &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and bl@@ ended in the coverage of a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and anywhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the abuse of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence of violence as well as , we say once , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
in addition , the report also covers incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Cathedral Treas@@ ury .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were report@@ edly har@@ assed and portra@@ yed and suffered horri@@ bly , took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where real sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger didn &apos;t have anything to do , because he only got the boys in his face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um .
on the one hand , like most witnesses , the theme of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even had positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asi@@ um , who even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the punishment would continue to be practiced in the pre @-@ school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing pen@@ alties in Bavaria had long been forbidden .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us knows well .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 , the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans are talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of evalu@@ ating past and present moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was ab@@ hor@@ rent and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is all very horri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be worked out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
its means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. , to sla@@ p the ear and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then prohibited , he was strictly adher@@ ed to .
which picture of his time of Regensburg has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ?
was the subject of Prü@@ m Pen@@ alty also available for speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells from his perspective that the Cathedral cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not by any means conc@@ eal that he had a strict regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally @-@ known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ b@@ ons alone one does not even make a great singer and before any success , no matter what territory , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience in conversations with their book by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep faith and hear@@ ty people , from whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something in a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ ines still keep in contact with him today , 23 years after his work , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him so far , that he once was stern to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the Cathedral cats are thank@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them close to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a loving resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look at and they almost worship them .
and please , once again , quite clear : all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just to make a man , just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intention behind it , all too obviously .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it .
now the stand @-@ up would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without which outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably not know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
