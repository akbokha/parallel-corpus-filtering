<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where it is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, because the car navigation system was a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the State Government, are anything but current - but very revealing.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork carpet, which one does not immediately recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large oversight card, detailed maps were drawn up for cities and municipalities, so-called documents of documents.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian surveying business, these were developed between 1810 and 1864 and have emerged from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops finally drew off with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, today's neighbors, who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "elector Max IV Joseph continued the project," "" "" "" "founded the" "" "" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The judgment sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling became a member of the Munich suburb for 21 years after the map was created.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, sub-sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian farmers "uprising against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-scale card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten flurries from the so-called "urine-mount" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no more farmers there today - but small farmers in the "Land in the Sun" plant.</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is distinguished north of sub-sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the case of the documents, in the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street name "at Gasteig" or "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße people once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle of Culture "On the Auer Ventilation" was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the betting of the so-called Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first room, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Refrigeration Institution in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatric clinics since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected - in architectural resemblance to the original building of the Irrensplatz, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed as "main place" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was named "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allies bombed a lot of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small businessmen and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days were preceded and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second suburban railway line took place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racial attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Missouri State, which is expected to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racially-based incidents occur lately throughout the country," says it in the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination complaints, and the state's law enforcement agencies which disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they have violations of the civil rights that happen to people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist abandonment against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no fuel during the journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report issued by the Office of the Missouri Attorney General, showing that black motorists in the state will hold 75 percent more common than whiteness.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "said Chapel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be willing to bring chewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, which accentuated the state in relation to the number of such violations in the 16th ranking of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of residential or employment discrimination." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU's view of further road profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weidezaun-Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-associated association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the right wing court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm in which he manages 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and as many kittens and houses holiday palaces in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternative marketing road for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionals can be found on the table of the Feriengaeeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also BLHV president of Fischbach, he described the fence project as "elementary important."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area provides a lot of work, much has to be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," "" "" "", "said Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental leave and managed to manage this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not perform bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "" "" "the Commune recognized the meaning of the fence project and is happy about the leader advancement." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to support farmers at the cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the surfaces could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how to continue their operation," "" "" "" "said the mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion.</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-air area therefore amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be forearmed up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fishersbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 Euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "" "" "stated Schwendemann." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landwomen you don't." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "also for Peter Weiß stood firm:" "" "" "" "the best foods are produced here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Architecture (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will allow the state funding of white fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor set described by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the fenced area may not be tugable (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishbacher Weidezine project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-air area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans cherish these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals on the drastic limitation of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have bothered him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it took its importance, and in particular the meaning that it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly speaking, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, your oppressed masses who are longing to breathe freely," the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trumpet USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural engagement: it is indeed a conflict about America's meaning.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical diagram.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus altered this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatism that brings the American flame to the sealed world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and at all a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, elenden, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump never want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power ignites.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the crew to captain of the team.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championships in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scotsman are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which is to be observed after a great season that included the victory of the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases they are also involved in the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being a special team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team mates voted for me and chose me, it makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics over Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the local voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He inoculated with the criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "because in 1783 Washington said," "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And this is why the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," many people said.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skilful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of individuals who come to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum, is considered officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans championed the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and these are just genuine people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not water-filled, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the news broadcast "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't like this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective deployment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "what the staff of the Governor described as" "" "" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "" "" "would probably call" "" "" "" "intercession" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in previous times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or to arrest and silence the demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County finally injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of an affordable meal had a similar effect on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter recorders suggested to his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Porcio," wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain overpower his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online paper of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse belong to the foundation of our nation.</seg>

<seg id="271">The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.</seg>

<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wood resources worth $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military is maintaining a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars, including up to $150,000 in a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="292">In fact, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokois's inauguration in October.</seg>
<seg id="293">On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.</seg>

<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the threat of danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.</seg>

<seg id="346">Paniai was always an immemorial for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribe of Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested in custody under the pretext of the "security of national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>

<seg id="354">The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as far out of reach.</seg>

<seg id="365">In addition, restrictions of international media coverage remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">At the beginning of the year French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although the rare permission to film was given to them.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelin Kine, the vice-president of Human Rights Watch, the promises were not realized by Jokois's election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's intranquil eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>

<seg id="372">The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "there is still a democratic system in Indonesia, and there are free media, making it difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases."</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed that they were late discovered that they were mistakenly using firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet-Charterservice, Stratos Jet Charters Inc., - also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules.</seg>

<seg id="411">The most common items that were intentionally towed to TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent admitted to have knowingly carried items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male surveyors also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had caused the airport security and how many had deliberately done it.</seg>

<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in Britain 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.</seg>
<seg id="428">At the moment, 455,000 such non-binding reservations occur at a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "all models should be taken together in 2018 - 500.000, 2020 a million." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, reservations are made per day of 1800.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today must reckon with the delivery at the earliest in the second half of the year - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines that are never tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if it comes to larger delays, then the obligation of reservations may become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from being run away in flocks.</seg>
<seg id="439">EPA chief Pruitt is moving from the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environment Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the governmental environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a deadline agreed on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for soil-related ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt explained in June that he would delay the observance for a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering in local decisions or to impede economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations aimed at resisting the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden shift from Wednesday is the latest legal advice for the section regulatory roll back agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methane lecks.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "under former administrations, the EPA often failed to comply with deadlines for the execution and then waited to be indicted by activists groups and others," "" "" "", "said Pruitt, who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="451">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take the deadlines seriously." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="452">"" "" "" "we also take the law and the authority we give us seriously." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="453">However, the EPA statement said that at some point Pruitt will use his "power to delay and all other legal powers available" to ensure that the provisions are based on a sound policy and the best available information. "</seg>
<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the Ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of the States who had sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the conversion of EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," "" "" "" "said Schneiderman."

<seg id="459">New York included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.</seg>
<seg id="460">Soil ozone arises when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="461">The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and thousands of premature deaths each year.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and promoter tumours their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "" "" "Walter Martini accentuates:" "" "" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischer registry: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen together with Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark of silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger mountain apart from the former parish church there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or patronage belonged and not the other way around.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people living there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the most beautiful village of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 underpin these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage came from Early Middle Ages.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master, who built a church, buried and occupied with a priest, remained owner of this church and was able to inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a pastor or to present a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two is broken at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were smashed and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were placed near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church-chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery served as the last resting place for the victims of hearing Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the graveyard was expanded and the Hilariuskirche was aborted.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's night in 1834, a storm collapsed and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was aborted.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today's existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem care for the "creative pensioners" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius facility.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumarc meet on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery at St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann is talking about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To conclude the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade is only held in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for tumours and listeners.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of ours feel particularly committed to their home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to examine the approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Boisheim wears out" "" "" "" "does not see legal requirements for construction and has therefore turned to the Council." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim wears out" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">They are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, as at the time in Viersen a wind power concentration zone existed only at the time in Viersen.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes wind energy utilisation for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Only a few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind force concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but this had not been approved by the Düsseldorf District government because of a formation error.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to the lack of planning permission, the granted permission is still illegal and therefore also to take back," "" "" "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of" Boisheim "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">The current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "with this, the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance to the call.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the corresponding letter has been in Viersen since last week," "" "" "" "said a spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle marks it as an occasion to re-examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not mean that the procedure is stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">Looking at the proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the "Boisheim" association.</seg>
<seg id="520">New Re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four turbines, each with a height of 200 metres, on the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen is indirectly involved, has concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wishes to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langensalaer and people from the region will discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The Gewerbeverein and Municipal Authorities want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9, in order to attract the residents to the shopping spree in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the Trade Association, Christian König, announced, the "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend should sensitize customers to what offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket products.</seg>
<seg id="535">According to this, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local firms should present their apprenticeships.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre are to be invited to the Mitterbury shopping spree.</seg>
<seg id="538">In doing so, the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation, commercials are on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, so Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">The municipal administration and the business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">With this the business association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive city centre."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offerings such as the first "active day" to the well as well as on Sunday, talks with all trades and hosts in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potential is to be re-opened or re-opened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But many locals also lost the city center while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end all would have to contribute to reviving the city center - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">To overcome the lethargy with a network that partly multiplied, King had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, shared with the fact that the third "home shopping" day the nationwide, five Thuringian cities take part in the first time.</seg>

<seg id="635">A woman wearing a mourning dress stands above the corpses of the actors and leads Billie Holidays sad announcements of "Strange Fruit."</seg>

<seg id="883">New results published by Swedish asylum-age assessment tests</seg>
<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who have undergone a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of people tested are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started performing the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should take a closer look at the appraisal of age during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">Up to now, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to July 31, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "" "" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "" "" "possibly under 18 years old" "" "" "" "was." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the person's age is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we see no big difference in statistics of past months, the figures are pretty constant," "" "" "" "he said in The Local Magazine." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases suggesting that the investigated person was 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, when x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of men to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">Judging biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we can't safely say it, we shouldn't do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said to the Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of evaluating a child as an adult is small.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "the greatest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="903">Fully in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's going great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, head of construction at the Department of Public Transportation and Transport in the Government Presidency Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April the works began at the same time on all three refurbishment-needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Easy is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were erected in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted so-called bridge board.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a marginal fixation, which is also used as an operating lane.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to take place.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular touch-tightening sensation has required laying cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">In the run-up to the work, the residents were informed of the project by handouts.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crabs had to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting area towards Schramberg, traffic is regulated single-lane by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach place entrance, the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The costs for the three bridge constructions amount to 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise only difficult to bring under a hat.</seg>

<seg id="947">This also does it: at 8pm, a band for entertainment at the Rondellplatz takes care of various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD-Chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">There are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and Deputy Prime Minister Beatrix of Storch to keep their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">Something more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is short after 9pm to clean up.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can back - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="956">Petkov Solotrompeter is at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombone of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="1091">Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the editorial board of Germany (RND) and answers.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Mr Schmidt, How can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?</seg>
<seg id="1093">I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.</seg>
<seg id="1094">On the consumer protection portal www.grocery warnung.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.</seg>
<seg id="1095">The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Food monitoring is the task of the Bundesländer.</seg>

<seg id="1103">However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1104">This time the companies are not to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="1106">According to the current state of knowledge, production companies do not bear any immediate fault.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of the European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the executive organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play Rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that at some point PSG has to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can easily make money in order for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team by the power-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but they have to interact with legitimate sources of income that enable them to break even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, the UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare off excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will surely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros can be expelled at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (back then 82 million dollars), which later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will remain on 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that might attempt to outsource their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan enterprise could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments from the 2022 World Cup Committee of Organizing Committee.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar Cup ambassador will be ambassador and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easy to find.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA did not have preparatory talks with PSG over Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, because they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 with sales of EUR 542.4 million has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a clear case of" financial "doping" with the club and the state, "" "" "" "" said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar's last ownership of PSG. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.</seg>

<seg id="1159">Chocolat Frey board chocolates for Swiss Life in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet co-operation is in front of a possible end: the airline does not write the order again.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott endorsed a corresponding report from the newspaper "North West Switzerland" on request by the news agency.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1166">Swiss did not want to provide any information about the cost.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Business insiders estimate the order volume in accordance with "North-West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new tendering.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss since 2006 has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before the Swiss completed a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">The opportunity to place the logo was two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eighties, for the 90-he-year-grunge era (when the visionaries David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like the time is tight.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" functioned surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for a promising can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By sticking at the core of the gags - middle-aged actors play horny children who are grown up - they still managed to win the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults, who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes beyond the casting know principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that rols the cradle").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character prompts through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The charming Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy evil plot involved in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-spoken impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons sublices of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old hacker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random delusions that could invoke this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches that which I consider its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">Meanwhile, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon recalls a different kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde," and even to "GLOW" with its east-west ring-combat iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, gives the director a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also a comprehensive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synced in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans may do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">In six long episodes it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was reduced to a lesser extent, could better deliver its agitprop satire since Gregor and Iosef are always visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imaginary communist audience is that the Western culture can make all the food for a banquet.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian authors did not lie wrong: we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Strike against drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police succeeded in beating the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor Constance announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">In doing so, 15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials granted greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">During the same raids in Italy two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects Italians, there were German arrest warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of over 300 policemen were deployed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The mafia's members are accused of organised drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Since the summer of 2016, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany has been determined.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the large-scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">As a result of the investigations, the Italian nationals were mainly related to the Italian mafia.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Also a incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning, should go to the bank account.</seg>

<seg id="1232">The data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far.</seg>
<seg id="1234">In some cases, data from 1921 have been found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain sluggish as it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members in this month to increase, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly inflationary report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to almost 3% in the fall.</seg>

<seg id="1269">It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks starting February, although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the scope of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.</seg>

<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision on no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the increasing expectations for an interest increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1290">NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the NHS drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">NHS England announced that preexpositioning prophylaxis (prep), which could reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, are now delivered by health care for a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1293">He agreed to finance the trial after the Appeals Court confirmed that last year the Supreme Court ruled that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.</seg>
<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to permit registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medications are present in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours prior to intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">To those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable candidates will be identified, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on how to use it on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this great new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a transaction with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "" "" "" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">Now, as the prep test medicine has been obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people. "</seg>
<seg id="1313">Sharon Hodgson, shadow minister of health, said: "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us to step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living a great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, scaled down in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne's terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't pack her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived in Knightsbridge with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne's closet space and an mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate level in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the steel structure is quite complicated," "" "" "" "he explains." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so they were stacked over one another without having to bend down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge moufles lighting the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, room and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a bit of engineering went into it," "" "" "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is important so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a real estate agent will enter a rudimentary form and perform a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you don't love the electrical plug sockets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "" "" "these are important but they don't play with your heart." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from slightly more standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate imperium</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation because of one of the biggest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and Developer Colin De Lutis resides in a mansion in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has taken him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp controversy over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 to $85 million.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father Colin, described by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul holds USD 176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the press releases suggested by Colin have left him with what I considered for the best objects," "" "" "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearings of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950's and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to purchase the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the family's first jeans.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "" "" "she wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claims that Mark had paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "" "" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "" "" "Paul says," "" "" "" "on the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has behaved very much, even though he was a former member of the AFL board and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "" "" "only Colin responded by SMS to say" "" "" "" "I can't say much," "" "" "" "because the case is before the courts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and put our family name through the courts," he wrote.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumpet new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met at his first working day with leading employees, he represented a major issue in President Donald Trumple's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information coming into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "" "" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumpet's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair report from places to convince," "" "" "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "" "" "Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "" "" "the key to keep the Twitter habit" "" "" "" "under control, according to six ex-election officials," "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumpet's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign groups know something that we don't know to others - that Trumpets tweets without their interventions would have included even more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoided that trump controversy evokes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of competing parties will always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may foster their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide the president for strategic reasons beyond doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he is trying to find out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of chicans, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that in the past he has voiced false accusations and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "" "" "Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher also added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof to Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company gesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, about 30,000 nights per year were lost and revenues by the local tax were also lost.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered as a collective accommodation in the district office building, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placement of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Council of Communism.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious interested people in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The former Hotel Birkenhof has been building shuttles in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors have been torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old baths removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "" "" "everything should be" "" "" "" "nicely bourgeois" "" "" "" "later, as Thomas Scherer expressed himself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and meeting room are part of the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer stresses.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread broadly, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to specify precisely.</seg>
<seg id="1475">He reckons just under one million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outer plants are also brought forward, this is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard, there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.</seg>

<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first invitations of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time, specifically in the presidential elections in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between the Trumpet Election Team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, there are several men who acted as advisors to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller took a closer look at more and more trumps in the private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special promoter Trump personally stepped into the centre and forked the accusation whether the president may hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Juries is to examine the present evidence in possible crime scenes and decide whether prosecution should be raised.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore called anchor chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when these are larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to charge individuals with an oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN broadcaster, pre-loads were already issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who participated in the meeting were called upon to testify, it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trumpet's advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election leader Paul Manafort were also involved in the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting-up show that Mueller did not leave his work intimidating and that if necessary he wanted to act fast." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "nevertheless, the establishment of the Gremiums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1508">I have no reason to believe that something has changed in this statement, it was said in the Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because of this rape, allegations against Trump had become louder, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said before a Senate committee in June, Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After representing US media, the White House collected material against the special promoter and his staff.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent mediator of the Congress, as in the Watergate affair around the later recciated President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urge of the president of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented the draft laws on Thursday, after which the special promoter could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg driving in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic, a giant iceberg of the scarce seven-fold size of Berlin has been solved by the ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, weighing over a trillion of tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 km and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">A danger for people does not emanate from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg, according to research information is uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factor background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was a part of the Larsen-C ice shelf so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the tip of the antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the poise of waxes and abruptions several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scrapie is broken down there, writes AWI researchers Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shelf is in danger, as the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can crumble if a piece breaks in a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeib and Eisberg doesn't increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice age causes the glacier to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project for observation of the Antarctic (Midas) writes.</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI information, the Larsen-C-Schelven is the fourth-largest shelf of Antarctic with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">From the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural phenomenon and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "" "" "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is controversial whether the Larsen-C shelf will grow back or go back over the long term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers did not trace the demolition of this giant iceberg to climate change, however, in the past few decades, many of the Eisschelstre of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The drop in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed by about three degrees in the last 50 years and is thus one of the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacant jobs, the CDU asks you to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break the day of the circle has reached 41 new places in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the Mettmann district administration.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought-after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Approximately 620 entries were recorded for the places to be missed this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 unoccupied places in Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">They are sought by doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "according to the parties" "" "" "" "the administration should develop" "" "" "" "a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term demand for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented evaluation of applications.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, showing concrete measures for transverse entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "speech is from a regular" "" "" "" "public employer competition." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1569">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "high time for action so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long been worried about a lazy surprise already in the day of the circle, when he questioned the costs of personnel costs and the other parties amazed.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow an exit from the local employers' association." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the county government should strive for a house tariff, perhaps also in cooperation with the county-related cities" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay better for employees and officials when there is a public service charge.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented to professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, councilors Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the tone of NGO migrants emergency boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," "" "" "" "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German Relief Organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had effectively collaborated with human hands in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on the detailed plans of Ambrogio Cartosio's Italian prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are so sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "" "" "" "the organisation said in a statement on social media." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes dinghy-migrants, which are delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can sail so that the vessels can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the Prosecutor's Act, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of going beyond the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have, above all, an Italian police officer who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring about "essential changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up, Nobel prize-winner-organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF) is.</seg>
<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."

<seg id="1597">Ascents and trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin Outpost" and two guest riders met at Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeings.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Wine Festival at Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream layers.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for the long trials poppy.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the saline and the Volksfest sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again the lookout point to the viewpoint, connected by "flowge" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days, many metres of altitude have been announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers offered healing brine at the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobar also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and presents many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capacity.</seg>

<seg id="1726">It often became irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) and Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V-demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Utility Company (VTU), says: "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>

<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install exhaust gases from diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of paving the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1776">Mordillos Bases and laughter against sorrow</seg>
<seg id="1777">Mordillo was at times one of the most publicized cartoon draftsmen, the noose-noses of his figures are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85 the Argentinean is still drawing and working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message: laughter," "" "" "" "Because there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he became an artist, among other things, as an illustrator for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again, the artist let himself be inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo characters cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he is still on the table today, working almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">About calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and clocks, his cute figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack of thousands as a counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time his characters speak in the 3D film, which is supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He became a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to the diseases, which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, are causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to climate change, which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a micro-bacterium that transfers dwarf-cades, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only attracting tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaise said: "instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The workers of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They have been told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists will discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office that was the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the premise: enemies, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no retirement from violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspirer by Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist," "" "" "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, showing his smile with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit for discussing security," "" "" "" "says Ibarra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know the Why, we all mistrust everybody." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums of drug kings who are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, presumed ganglion bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the seizure of another newspaper published in the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined together with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "" "" "in Sinaloa," "" "" "" "it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the toxicity problem," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever she was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "" "" "trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "" "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the spaßbird, who could curses like a dockworkers, a friend who was generous with hugs and counsel, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask, Was his love for routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their job best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret launchers and runways" "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "" "" "said Bojorquez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrongly, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is going to happen with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggled, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room in which the workers from Riodoce met safety training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed. days before it was known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were mandated by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a central-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who were not trustworthy by the Governor himself.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters passed into the mountain landscape, where the gang of drugs de facto are under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known cabinet Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a posé on state expenditure focused on the hometown of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Public Prosecutor, which carried out a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost the whole century on all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have seen the Valdez column as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the past we would have known what happened," "" "" "" "said Villarreal, 46, with nickname" "" "" "" "El Flaco" "" "" "" "because of its slender body stature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of a further journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on footpaths and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez is gone to Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa, after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, the government officials involved and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "" "" "said Ramirez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head.</seg>

<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian mining worker have been preserved so well that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of an "troubled past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">The report in the journal Current Biology described it as "the upholstered dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well-preserved state has astonished researchers, who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armoured herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk as he dug on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossils discovered by him were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 lb. (1,100 kg) of heavy ground clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinwinkle with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will enter the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-coating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markedchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours covering it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shadowing is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There is evidence that the dinosaur has been hunted by sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the Cretaceous Age," "" "" "" "Brown said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on pointers on its life, including its preserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as its final meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At this time Alberta was as warm as Südflorida today, and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal," "" "" "" "Brown said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You do not need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous Period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he dug on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the padded dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raced from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater refund of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the crates of the house still cover bollusky armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as winning a lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole. "</seg>
<seg id="1971">Thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, kilometerlong Staus and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-München (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first data of the police, around 5.00 p.m. between the junction locations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, crashed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of the wounded leaves no information at first.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was light to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of emergency vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely locked in direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, a ten kilometer long tailgate was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported as a AZ reporter, it also occurred on the counter-road to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade fastened the hallmarks of the vehicle electricians, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 6: 45 p.m. there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car driver and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "Comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing beats the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffer.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes up an unsuspected or rips the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Timetable control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control system.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and thus devaluate the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation is running on two tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when the offer arrives, we expand it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "" "" "it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year," "" "" "" "said a railway spokesman." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" is the name of the railway timetable without conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">To use this, however, some requirements need to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have access to the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The "comfort check-in" works like this: you step into the train, call your ticket at "My Rates."</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for the electronic devaluation is then published with the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train attendant arrives at the passenger ticket inspection, he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket already used.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railways - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without any ticket control by our train attendant check in the DB Navigator themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This enables passengers to make their travel time in the train personal, "says Michael Peterson, DB's marketing executive vice-president.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "" "" "second plus:" "" "" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are among the greatest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the co-travelers not all the documents you need for devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the ID card or any other document that you have to show is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or large space and delays in controlling their own tickets and takes time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that only applies to the connections of ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Additional train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year-old child and it's still on the street," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Brown's leblooem body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "that's wild," "" "" "" "said Ferrell." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new to them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and by a man claiming to be Brown's father who wore a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson's police killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "" "" "in another video, she said, another policeman released his rifle and cried," "" "" "" "I will kill you... animals all." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not common," "" "" "" "Ferrell recalled their testimony." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we are used to and which we can call typical." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment, I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "" "" "I was angry and wept." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and power, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a cauliflower and a fitting crown, drove to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had "countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state.</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe?" "" "" "" "she remembered what she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "" "" "I couldn't take her with me," "" "" "" "said Ferrell later." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we must do to get rid of ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience, in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place facing the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to accept for Ferrell figure.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my activism totally changed after 9th August," "" "" "" "she said and noted that she was President of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, the Minority Student Nurses Association, focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to document what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "" "" "a question came from Ferrell:" "" "" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Like Folayan recently stated in an interview: "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt-Insassen.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we speak," "" "" "" "said Davis." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, for so I will be represented." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that the movement "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she turned out to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of black teenage Trayvon Martin have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media in 2012 identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "black gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether," "" "" "" "said Ferrell," "" "" "" "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "" "" "black gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "" "" "the movement is really held by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film due to their identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she was the person who stirred up this energy," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman stands so much in the game." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, even though it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct collapses the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject can hardly be found cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While some say a bit-gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That's really great" (Nicole Schaudest), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, including the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery will be planned exactly on the property on which the farmer's market hall is located, in which 13 direct markets offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work it will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-plaza with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone rooms: "for many years we have been shopping for almost every week in the farmer's market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land women are very happy again and again.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>

<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the local rents are often not portable to a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging from the ceiling on cables.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Intelligence Analyst banished a 35-year custodial sentence after publicly announced diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg, through algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning, has created a sharp, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law of espionage, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning as she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal briefs that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Supported Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would convert Chelant's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">The fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, would ask Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome form of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump carries a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetrable ways to further inflame the rigid splits he was supposed to fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen to happen for a specific reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for the "i" in her surname (the "i" in her surname is endowed with a heart) an end to the "automatic fracturing, the foundation of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Span Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the aforementioned Comic Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she shows up with a hands-free phone in the hands of the United States "disciplinary arcades like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when they let down your speech, they have won," "" "" "" "says it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "" "" "said the artist who greeted him from Philadelphia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2153">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I still get goosebumps when I talk about it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacres that gather like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, right up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg told the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2159">A nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looking for suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) warrants arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the County Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubul, the vice president for university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem should now be certified and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.</seg>

<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, which had just received a mysterious hint that said that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as being very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2181">The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency (Rusada).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, Rusada has granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for the re-entry of Rusada and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he doesn't contain anything that could cause Russia to worry about Russia.</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In conversation with the Russian outlet rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "" "" "no one is afraid to accept this report unconditionally," "" "" "" "added Smirnov." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">Rusada was expelled in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal of the WADA by the execution of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, to provide specific groups and demographic groups, to address employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most discomforts and which leaders have low approval outcomes - so that you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the financial engineering site Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent Enterprise can send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the head of the business is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the court of public opinion has seized the regulators," "" "" "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaved unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover, and lawsuits, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company's headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent applies, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states were hidden - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practice - can be identified quicker and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vitrano who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders against employment law disputes." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies started to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 when the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "" "" "but it took until the" "" "" "" "social media" "" "" "" "came to their right" "" "" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors, who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convercent received $10 million for financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2239">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "when people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "" "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT."

<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee involvement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the caretaker of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough or not at all, this can prompt disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4,000 talks," "" "" "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies too much on collecting data." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem about GLINT is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, they were able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run this leads to better bonding of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2304">He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with patrons, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "" "" "then, at night he drank" Whiskey and started to write. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last bay, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent what possessed: "one could think that country conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go their way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history, among them 'The Labourer', which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant revolt of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.</seg>
<seg id="2312">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the peasant revolt started in this area and I thought it was a good start." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe they are connected with each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patter, which the family Darrell hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell portrayed his own funeral by filling a coffin filled with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite feeble, repeatedly making debts and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men redeemed their school debt by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise Erwithin. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his work in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique screaming experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the area of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Turkey's military reforms - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises in Ankara on pensions and promotions in officers "corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal operation.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building, just as before, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the head of the head of the government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the consultations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the overcount.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is pulling the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the Commander of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wire drawing of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup d "état as a" gift of God, "as he gave him the opportunity to fully cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading "Undiscomfort in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">As a general staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifested itself in the lifting of the prohibition of headscarf for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The case with the army and the security forces goes on in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan was devoting more 7395 servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were earlier than the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times, they putted their role as a guardian of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan repressed the power of the military step by step, not least with regard to the reform specifications of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan is targeting Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a particularly unnamed officer who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the attempted coup attempt, the Turkish army would be "full extremists and salafists in a few years."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO chilly.</seg>
<seg id="2363">In any case, in the alliance with the purges, there is doubt about the readiness to use the Turkish army.</seg>
<seg id="2364">"" "" "" "the management structures and operational capabilities are" "" "" "" "weakened" "" "" "", "say Nato diplomats." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2365">Washington changes the rules for the Green Card</seg>

<seg id="2367">He intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining visa for temporary work permits and restrictions for family-oriented visas.</seg>
<seg id="2368">The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for race track</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months over the future of the competition shuttles has been fought over and over again - now it's supposed to go very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year it is supposed to be built on the steep stretch of the tourist rail.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the competition shuttles in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route will begin this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with the decision to further order and sanitise the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is particularly related to tourism," "" "" "" "said Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the track were estimated at approximately 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country overtakes 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalised, declared Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators have already agreed on the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," "" "" "" "said Sühl." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This means that the Rennsteig shuttle should be ordered regularly in December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, a pilot operation has been tested, whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also in parts strongly bumpy.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of the FRR, we have to start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver lots of it and we will see them much more often," "" "" "" "said Mr. Sharkey on the release of his new report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the robotic eye color to the shape of the nipples up to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the "personalities" that would make a steppe-woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexputers have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing like shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, giving the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," "" "" "" "enthuses the True Companion website." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "" "" "" "be in mood" "" "" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah is concerned, trouble a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his site True Companion Roxxxy distributed with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have any Roxxxy?" "" "" "" "is it on the website." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices their growing popularity, they remain temporary at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is permeated from the boundary conditions can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has been boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') is not the graphical images, the intricate body and the enochoned eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personages," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companions.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the 2017 phrase: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumpets Big Performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a wisdom of the Trump-era that the political divisions that the U.S. voters have polarized also divided families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all rigorously trying to make our filter bags burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less has been noted is the power of Trumpet to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House anyone who knows it, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades on account of politics suddenly and quite strangely on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but I notice that this also involves considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalisation" and trump, we refer to the spooky way that one day his kittens will no longer be repelled.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republicans of the Right wing, "which suddenly seem to be the epitome of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur to a very mild offense.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are creaky and the animals twisted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go to it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced in a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing grinsing while I wearied the experience to submit my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pains moved from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">In the past year, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist, which according to the prison authorities suffered a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Due to the murder of the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appel, of which they say they are too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the National prosecution authority said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="2459">As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg</seg>
<seg id="2460">As the last of the Blumberger schools, the Viertklässler from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Three of the dismissal students go to secondary school in the future, four to the secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening school director Angelika Sitte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>
<seg id="2463">As a symbol of the dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes voted by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder a young eagle that grows up in the chicken farm, but then released into freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2464">In addition, the mess Schar conducted a musical with the title "The Eagle in the chicken farm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it broods from his chickens.</seg>
<seg id="2466">Instead of a chicken kens a little eagle came out.</seg>
<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of it smashed, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and swore.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that, classes three and four showed a hen's dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young shovels, who wore the cylinders to the bet.</seg>
<seg id="2470">The Eagle stands for integration, said school director Angelika Sitte.</seg>
<seg id="2471">The young animal is different from the other kittens (chicks), but belongs to it.</seg>
<seg id="2472">But he will never be like a chicken.</seg>
<seg id="2473">His destiny is to be free.</seg>
<seg id="2474">She wished for every four-teller that he felt accepted in his new school.</seg>
<seg id="2475">It followed thanks to the colleagues, former head of school Michael Müller, who always jumps back in teaching passes, and the parents' representatives.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The kitchen time is over now, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.</seg>
<seg id="2477">After two years of teaching, she won't leave her students very reluctant, because it had been a really great time.</seg>
<seg id="2478">Finally she was able to rely on the Viertklässler.</seg>
<seg id="2479">At the end all students heard a song of summer time and holiday time.</seg>

<seg id="2485">On the same day, they were released while an investigation is underway.</seg>
<seg id="2486">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported BTV that the Bulgarians were released later.</seg>
<seg id="2487">The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose, considerable fines.</seg>

<seg id="2525">Ll Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center.</seg>
<seg id="2526">As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) belong to the scholars this year.</seg>
<seg id="2527">The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Traditionally, U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a reception and join his wife Melania at the ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The award winner Lear, announced with progressive TV series, already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala.</seg>

<seg id="2531">The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the interview with Trump to clarify her view.</seg>
<seg id="2532">The Kennedy Center, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Among the previous award winners are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.</seg>
<seg id="2534">We make the city worth living</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will be in Rente next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city supervisor for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work always makes him great fun, as he mediates in press conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports from varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">In this way - considering the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision to be done.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach has acted as Lower Building Law Authority for the Board of Directors, the applicant must show appropriate statements.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they would no longer be able to fill them out, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity to the city is important to the city and to it itself, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back on the Wacker with pride.</seg>
<seg id="2548">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we make the city worth living," "" "" "" "he is confident about the construction department and his employees." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen parkplace are about to be encountered.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, including the stadium renovation is still subject matter.</seg>
<seg id="2551">"" "" "" "the latter alone will come to terms with some 1.5 million euros," "" "" "" "if we do it right," "" "" "" "Wacker believes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successor.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">There is a large play area for a city building master.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Thanks to Haslach's own building yard and nursery, it is possible to react flexibly to versatility.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "" "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town is listed as an ensemble under historic preservation, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the former mayor emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the Stadtbaumeister has a high degree of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "" "" "he is a builder," "" "" "" "at the end everything runs here over my table." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">With care and coordination he can count on many years of experience: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Wacker wishes his successor for a long time too: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you want to be buried by Roland Wacker, according to the town of Haslach, you should have a completed degree in engineering or a bachelor with a specialist in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Municipal Building Department is subject to civil and civil engineering, construction planning, real estate matters, urban properties management, urban farm with building yard and urban gardening, as well as lower building rights authority including monument protection.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle drawn on lines: South rail track locked</seg>
<seg id="2566">According to the police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track superseduction in the area of Leoben Straße (B116) on the lines.</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and are looking for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Close to the crime scene a rosary roller and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses.</seg>

<seg id="2571">The perpetrators, or the perpetrators, would have put themselves into great danger and jeopardized the train traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay-arc and the costs for rail transport traffic, there could also be pönalen from the railway customers to the perpetrators.</seg>

<seg id="2574">The damages were repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south side track could be led without any disabilities.</seg>
<seg id="2575">Just under ten passenger trains were off for Friday morning, two of which were related to the long-distance traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains were not falling, but they had delay.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to the ÖBB Speaker Christoph Posch, some 200 meter overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food cannot penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance goes too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movement when the same system will also work with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examines a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was divided apart, had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then translated small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the fodder of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells steer inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "" "" "high tryptophan values can potentially lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2604">Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a "genius" to Nemanja Matic</seg>
<seg id="2605">With Nemanja Matic, Manchester United signed a "genius," Jose Mourinho writes after the midfielder on Wednesday evening had his debut against Sampdoria.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The 40 million pound inscription of Chelsea started with a 2: 1 victory in Dublin, the last low season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid kicked off on Tuesday, and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched on as they like.</seg>
<seg id="2607">However, Matic was excluded from the pre-preparatory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes, which gave Mourinho that he had to improve before the Premier League season.</seg>
<seg id="2608">"he needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.</seg>
<seg id="2609">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we will help him to be prepared sooner than later." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2610">Beside Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started in the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments but he insisted that the club has already done a "fantastic job" to fulfil three of its four priority new obligations.</seg>

<seg id="2615">The U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which are several thousand kilometers.</seg>
<seg id="2617">The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The radar shield was the form of a Dreamliner.</seg>

<seg id="2622">New draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem</seg>
<seg id="2623">As the wind turns out: when Sigmar Gabriel was still an SPD leader, Social-Democratic Prime Ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Nothing but a fire from the central party, but no headwind from the League, was the most important wish of the election militants.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the Willy-Brandt-House employees are observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year, would not have been described in the approach with headwind.</seg>

<seg id="2631">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this once again shows that red-green cannot reliably rule," "" "" "" "said CDU-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND)." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2632">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the surprising Group president of a Green Party deplored the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the election, its red-green coalition lost its one-voice majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green Party managing director Michael Kellner called on the backsliding Lower Saxony Green Party Elke Twesten to return her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the transfer to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electoral welcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Twesten has to return her mandate immediately, "said the Federal President and election campaign manager of the Greens Editorial Board (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it must not be true at all," "" "" "" "an SPD election champion sighed, when the new Hiobsmessage reached party headquarters on Friday morning." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transition of the green deputies Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional peak of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD country associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And nobody knows what's next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, more not, the comrades at that time calmed down.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the legislative elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">That was also - and everything got much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The SPD defeat brought the SPD in exchange, the Düsseldorf-bankruptcy smoothed the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades were laboriously raging back in the weeks after that.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just exhausted new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next gravure.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country squad, lost his Nimbus in that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in the communication of the crisis it was almost everything that could be done wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz fought for political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">Because of the VW-Exhaust and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Hypotheses were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil always tried to accentuate in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They let him grant him, because they promised to stabilize the party from Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could occur.</seg>
<seg id="2659">At the same time, Weil finds no fault with the party-internal force of the Lower Saxony Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz is not at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">At times, comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their anger is directed toward the Greens, and here above all to the backsliding parliamentarians in the West.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is intolerable and democratic, as Mrs. Twesten put their own career on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Mrs. Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person, but on the regional list of the Lower Saxony Greens in the Parliament, so the Lower Saxony member continues.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains an "undemocratic maneuver."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the voters" "" "" "" "four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil as Prime Minister," "" "" "" "says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a candidate for the Bundestag election, the RND." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2671">Funding for city center III</seg>
<seg id="2672">Those who want to rehabilitate his house in the years can get support from the country soon.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development informed on Wednesday in emotion.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a review of what was happening.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been in feelings sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, previous refurbishments are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote interior development and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euro came from the country, the rest from the church sentiments.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How is a remediation area now being developed?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "one will continue to examine so Schindler where the" really old "houses are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">It also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area limits may also be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening, the STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Keller presented the contents of the federal states program "Social City," in which the refurbishments would then be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is revitalization of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions, and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then eventually be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grant period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, the stock survey would only be carried out in the framework of those involved in filling out a questionnaire for the participants in the rehabilitation field.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the order of the statutes is to be carried out in the shortest possible time, so that in the coming year it is possible to start renovations.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently explained that every municipality must carry out the said preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about assessing the situation of urban development and to decide when to sanitise and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There is also a sanitation note in the register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come back again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that the project was a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, questionnaires will be sent that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "Building and Property Sheet" in which it works, among other things, about the structural condition and renovation views.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the gray questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet," information on size, division and inhabitants of a residential space can be made.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"" "" "" "the blue" "" "" "" "operating sheet" "" "" "" "can only be filled out when operating in the building premises." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">Moreover, new building measures are not conducive to support.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler stressed that the distribution of the funding is working according to the 'greyhound principle' - who comes first, first admonishes.</seg>
<seg id="2705">You cannot reserve funds for later.</seg>
<seg id="2706">At the end, photos of the project "Location II" were shown to make the participants a "tasty."</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that raises the American production last month will cost taxpayers according to the military supplies that have been left to the TIME magazine up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">In addition to a yacht from Maine, a fireman from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi, the helicopter was built in Connecticut.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," "" "" "" "wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the flight departure from the White House would be delayed, due to the limitation of service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination.</seg>

<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of the health reform going on in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church," declared after publication in relation to the German Press Agency, he was expecting an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "" "" "the Vatican paper" "" "" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "" "" "on the other hand, criticised that" "" "" "" "double standards" "" "" "" "were measured in reporting about violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the interference in Regensburg no one doubt that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "" "" "writes Scaraffia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also commented in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go to the church and that's a devoured Fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "" "" "Schlatings" "" "" "" "had been a normal pedagogical tool" "" "" "" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they are unfair to apply today's standards to past decades, as the world has changed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the "My Brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I must take George Ratzinger in protection," "" "" "" "says Hesemann," "" "" "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "" "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment Attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assault, 67 Domspatzen sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is written about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be noted that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially at high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "nevertheless, unlike many other accusations, many victims overestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger has relied on his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence in protective guards at the Regensburger Domspatzen" is a conflicting image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many students emphasise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became handgrieved by the eye if there was no musical top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all there.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exempted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence of violence at the preschool occurred outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to reproach him at best, to know too late or to have taken the first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all surveyors as "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also testifies to an excellent record, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as a very good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to wound outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knock with chairs and threw the key on the ground, but also swayed the slap and too naughty guys on the hair or ears, he himself acknowledged, deeply regretted and apologized for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in questionable time, 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a secular school, a grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In comparison with what it's all about in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, these are certainly bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not more of his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media reported much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put some involvement or complicity with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to be entrusted with the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even commit themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who, professionally, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-student Ratzinger's role with regard to the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a well-asked disciple put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... there is no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely findings and could have halted the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that baskets are impenetrable or clearer or even more open than towards their parents, dormitory managers, trustworthy teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "" "" "that one talks about sex with him... - unthinkable." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "" "" "it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In this way, it cannot be accused of preventing or having brought it to light.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "" "" "in the media there was a lot of" "" "" "" "abuse of violence" "" "" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and blended in the coverage of a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and anywhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence of violence as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report also covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Cathedral Treasury.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were reportedly harassed and portrayed and suffered horribly, took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where real scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger didn't have anything to do, because he only got the boys in his face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, like most witnesses, the theme of "preschool" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even had positive memories with him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the accusation remains to be taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "" "" "in this he points out to them," "" "" "" "that the punishment would continue to be practiced in the pre-school." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing penalties in Bavaria had long been forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the people might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "" "" "Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about" "" "" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "" "" "", "i.e. the danger of evaluating past and present moral standards." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abhorrent and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is all very horrible and I am glad that it will finally be worked out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Its means for disciplining and punishment, i.e., to slap the ear and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then prohibited, he was strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his time of Regensburg has given Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of Prüm Penalty also available for speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells from his perspective that the Cathedral cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not by any means conceal that he had a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally-known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone one does not even make a great singer and before any success, no matter what territory, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience in conversations with their book by Georg Ratzinger?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep faith and hearty people, from whom one can't imagine that he could only do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspines still keep in contact with him today, 23 years after his work, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him so far, that he once was stern to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Cathedral cats are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them close to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving respectable person, to which they still look at and they almost worship them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again, quite clear: all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust to make a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, all too obviously.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand-up would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without which outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany would probably not know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
