28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Lei@@ ch@@ n@@ am , found in the West@@ field Mall on Wednesday morning , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ ic@@ ia from San Francisco distributed the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia , shared the ABS broad@@ c@@ aster K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had captured his dream job as a chef at S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were sho@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia stated that Frank first lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
his way of connecting with his family was to cook us a little , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ ic@@ ia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confron@@ tation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lit every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the information on the SF@@ PD number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in a drawer
Jennifer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or glu@@ ed onto labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are more likely to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is seen as Miss Perfect as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
most of the time , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , at the front of the TV with loos@@ ened de@@ bris and Mexican food , says it in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s game &quot; Ani@@ ston can be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film will run with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport py@@ rami@@ de &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled their holidays , they hun@@ ted home in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the food console .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the riding career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was all times - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again near horses .
he let himself manage with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even fly for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports field handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport Py@@ ramid .
the sympath@@ ic ath@@ l@@ ete l@@ acks awards at awards .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th lau@@ re@@ ate of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ time US master &apos;s winner was recorded in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander Pus@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ro@@ wer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um@@ der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stadi@@ on where the Lav@@ azza Prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential evalu@@ ators are at odds with tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a basic , rather philosophical differences .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive back regul@@ ators massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged odds and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the need to invest , tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic applicants are even announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical se@@ ap@@ ot wing of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
thus , there could be still party @-@ internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are clear@@ er .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining again in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement wants to quit .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ orter @-@ fish trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better .
they should be paid better then , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of USD 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ end , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tr@@ ump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics stop him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who fled has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who escape alone .
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen , four women sit .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized shel@@ ters for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman arriving here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as a hope to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
whoever believes that the end , as soon as they are in Germany , is ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble , re@@ counts B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in the Munich north are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about what has happened because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodation just for them , challenges B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some reply with no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no such thing in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , wing@@ ed women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , the press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy , or will men and women be accommod@@ ated , it may be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the queu@@ e that there is on the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily build a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands for new work fighting measures
assistant to assistant physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour disputes at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have agreed to deal with concerns about the contract .
medical students and medical students have voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; would have remained in trouble , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and call for official re @-@ negotiations with all your worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour disputes that began at the beginning of September .
the disputes resulted in the fact that assistance doctors struck six times this year , the first overall out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ ungen Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forced into force .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; out@@ sider &quot; alliance ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to give themselves their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight @-@ month long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be nar@@ ro@@ wer and radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan once spoke of his dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there had never been any worse .
for me , his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but a sustained cooling by Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory remarks : the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was angry .
Putin den@@ ounced and accused Ankara to appeal to Russia .
the passing was even greater , since it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ build the confidence is difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the alle@@ g@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan would have benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could win a sort of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily needed all the friends he can get after he has been ab@@ duc@@ ted by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat in almost his office last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late a@@ ison@@ ous rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish ag@@ r@@ arian imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti wrote it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y as an anal@@ ysts once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and badly treated and now alli@@ ed themselves .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave its role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said that they would not even have stra@@ pped the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliberately failed to answer a question of their differences , while Putin decided to acc@@ entu@@ ate them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster - when NATO member Turkey threw off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ user financial brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the exchange listing on Nat@@ West will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail banking that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand in which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am now saying we don &apos;t pursue global goals , but local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be able to continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can re@@ design these marks , so I think the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market at Pre@@ dic@@ tation
D@@ ett@@ ori bub@@ bles champagne for a double at New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori took his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ vent@@ ing , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey reaching the milestone in the flat race .
he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ er when he wins the victory at Pre@@ dic@@ tation
two jo@@ ckey players reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ winner had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career horses
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Modernis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thr@@ illed fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already taken 6.000 profits if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already scored nearly 30 years of winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from flying fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot , 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and won a ban on drugs .
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to de@@ fy his doubts and to return to his best form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least fifty years of age .
Russia Putin fire@@ places chief of staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dism@@ issed President Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s closest confidence circuit .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin it reads that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ovo ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been deputy director since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s emb@@ assy .
on the Krem@@ lin website it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became head of the head of the head of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important job of the government to support your activity as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the sm@@ iling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov , for a long time , was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works like him for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff resig@@ ns on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official claim - that a man , who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks on Putin that are c@@ ited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated position - one could almost say - to entr@@ ust the post office for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the German Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was named his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was once believed that according to Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia since a third term of Turkey had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest rival to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confron@@ tation on the set of the Los Angeles series last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , reported in a joint statement his dism@@ iss@@ al .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dism@@ iss@@ al .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the planned broadcasting of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28th .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff demanded help in the identification of the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act around Sand@@ ale , which were mir@@ r@@ ored by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fishes .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge Connec@@ ted with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four locks of the &quot; deck blo@@ wer &quot; approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 s@@ las@@ hes .
the project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tri@@ cky activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the entire bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete sla@@ b for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower roof , we had to close the existing gap on the north or north side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern loading bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very tri@@ cky activity .
massive as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate because the toler@@ ances , on which the team was working , were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat twi@@ sted near and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have blown the boat out of its reach until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing vessel , while the third man was exhausted in the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boom with no life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have luckily un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone guar@@ ded these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex girl@@ friend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed to her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
this al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex girl@@ friend .
who will build affordable housing of Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be put into duty a lot more strongly in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; room for action living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first of all , it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must point out 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favourable flats may , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
but the big issue in the town hall is , however , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and still needs to be financed should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants investors to make as few rules as possible .
the left wants tough@@ er support for investors .
not@@ with@@ standing , as Brat@@ mann , there is a ti@@ ghtening of the situation in the housing market .
if the scope of action is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of another 1300 low @-@ priced apartments , which will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing the apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
the problem could be solved on one stroke .
at the end of the year , Fri@@ sten is running in the West@@ stadt .
some 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dras@@ tically , it is removed from the aim of the so @-@ called inter@@ mix .
there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect there will still be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leader of the Group : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has focused on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer spending their free time with them , star@@ ing on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about bringing people out of the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and finally on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , there was a decline in the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tur@@ f and j@@ umped for the sofa .
in the US , the game has led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that the &quot; average &quot; person sets aside every day .
Cardi@@ ogram , an Apple Watch app that pursu@@ es 3@@ 5,000 users , the Washington Post recently shared that within two days of market launch , the number of follow @-@ up people who exercise 30 minutes each day , j@@ umped by 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes time &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; hit de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring and come from people looking forward .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ stated .
whoever drives sport regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close friends on the hunt .
as always there are also gru@@ elling game cor@@ rup@@ t@@ als , which must always complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what should I do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier .

dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .

on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast conven@@ ed on Thursday for the title of the battle and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light for the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winners and &quot; Final Five &quot; team com@@ bi A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bal@@ es on the Swedish bar during the sing@@ ular campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ is is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multiple battle title and overall the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought her sports to new heights :
Bil@@ a has won the last three years of her sport , 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champ@@ ions of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a last review in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the ath@@ l@@ ete , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ a won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as excl@@ am@@ ation mark on the f@@ arewell celebration of the team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i who retired in retirement .
although Bil@@ o insi@@ sted that , during her long journey to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school departure in the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she hasn &apos;t lost any competition competition , a winning series that will last as long as it wants .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily led by two turns , the picture dec@@ ei@@ ves .
Swedish bars and ground floor@@ ings - in which Bil@@ is holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she returned with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 placed on the floor one more .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her grand@@ child - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on fine glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her collective book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after their ground exercises she hur@@ led to the audience kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ o is concerned , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :

according to police reports published on Thursday two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass murder case by Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a gun fire while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y case , since the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 that were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard stated that the sho@@ ot@@ ings led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in h@@ is@@ panic housing areas within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which was scra@@ pped on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder , and it was assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ enc@@ ephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s getting better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his contemp@@ or@@ aries , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder where his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I won &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has embar@@ ked on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with a help .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or cra@@ wl up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is progres@@ sing slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has conceived for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the with the Z@@ ik@@ abo@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives reason to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards , Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana , shared with the local authorities that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had claimed tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over long parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Satur@@ days .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inch of rain could drop in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood @-@ early warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood a lot of houses in the subur@@ ban areas near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ stream caused by down@@ stream in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still p@@ ens@@ ed people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose greatly over night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that another step @-@ son who lives nearby should have warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flo@@ wed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the flood had spread rapidly , as there were heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rain has been considerably so@@ wn by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that severe ra@@ inf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and school trips in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both now floo@@ ded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a nearly two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand bags provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Count said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday no reported .
Keith To@@ wn@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; To@@ wn@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived sho@@ ot@@ ings in Philadelphia
the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several gun injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has gone through a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I simply can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the broad@@ c@@ aster that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical state , reported to the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , H@@ ül@@ sen were located .
in this way , there seems to be several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; said Police Department Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia .
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross ra@@ cket at her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who have inspired many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ o@@ lics , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic trav@@ eller and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected yet master@@ ful gy@@ m@@ astic routines .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see sports classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie were all beating the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic Games will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily used in private gymnas@@ tics , which are maintained by parents , arising for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these clubs lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs which can support business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to be inspired by the communities of au@@ n countless young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach training .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um 20 years ago .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trains national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high quality gymnas@@ tics to the youth , who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to interest in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by Hol@@ en des olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants want to organise more strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 resident doctors who voted on a vote rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty for@@ ci@@ bly and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be harmful to employees and patients .
the first assist@@ ants are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve the maintenance of the working hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assist@@ enz@@ ologists said last night in a message with &quot; Assist@@ enz@@ ologists still have serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will inc@@ ite the current Occup@@ ational Cris@@ is and it will be used to treat all the doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to solve the disputes through talks have appe@@ aled to the government for relu@@ ct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on ear @-@ num@@ bing silence .
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only done last month that his door would always open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to raise the condition and address the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of almost 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting coverage to doctors on the strip @-@ chain cover .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assist@@ ants to end the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work fighting measures do not achieve anything that is little , but already strain relief teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ ers and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
over the past two months we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant physicians and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es .
employers hoped that continuing positive involvement on other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional apprentices@@ hip , training teachers , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ a day drug after advised by the authorities to administ@@ er this more people for a longer period .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the NI@@ CE regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further .
the NI@@ CE regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form coverings .
when the layer breaks apart , a blood cl@@ ots can cause blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the inau@@ g@@ ural concept of NI@@ CE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of asp@@ ir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with asp@@ ir@@ in in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
by pro@@ visional recommendations from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness will blo@@ om electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office for corruption last year due to corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness holds that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is unk@@ now@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today .
Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally att@@ aches the police , ob@@ servers and coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Commun@@ al Government , who is now a cor@@ rup@@ tion@@ ist politi@@ cian , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lock@@ ers outside of electoral cabins to protect registered vot@@ ers .
he recommends that vot@@ ers should have a passport to prove their identity in elections .
currently , a vot@@ er has to name his name and address .
the report suggests not to apply remote ink on a person &apos;s finger if they release their elec@@ tive voice to prevent anyone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the current mayor of Lut@@ sk was to be dism@@ issed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cally &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation where one person cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud in the country .
he spoke in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter @-@ election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , illustrated , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leadership of ID cards to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof it was established that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ ian background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such a behaviour based on &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists work on letter @-@ selection documents to stop &quot; harv@@ esting . &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration reviews to prevent the voting directory being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses two times .
conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a 3 year limitation on applications to an automatic letter @-@ selection .
ban on political activists to process full postal elections and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ heads .
the police have authority to set up barriers to set up electoral stations .
a change of law which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act .
no phot@@ ographi@@ es in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff generally asser@@ t that vot@@ ers alone enter the electoral cab .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Court issued Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the town coun@@ cils elec@@ tives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said , &quot; The Jud@@ gement Tower in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country is a proud heritage as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .

but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by no means the only one to have gold fighting ath@@ l@@ ete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you dare to believe the social media .
in honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that have more than a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in Archery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures where he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher received the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking fellow , so I feel it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take the spot@@ light this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
a step higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal winner Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and blonde hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory placed in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user expressed their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope is Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the U.S. football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alists in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , showing her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald &apos;s analysis of the 4th place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Hai@@ han at dr 4x@@ 200m Freestyle swimming pool s@@ wir@@ led spectators of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; went off &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS &apos;s commentary team to give more colour , one could hear : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited she went down like a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swimming teacher Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible for Canada to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were sho@@ cked by sound and language .
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ Far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming pool for women as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was quick and hard , in which many people asked him
Twitter users didn &apos;t think back when they heard how un@@ ensi@@ c By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and make all of us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly afterwards , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance being broadcast . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ gt about Twitter
the comment fellow Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly at our audience yesterday night and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swimming pool and not on it as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swimming teacher and not on her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no contemp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I am very sorry about it . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman trying sham@@ elessly in the midst of shop sham@@ elessly under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to go when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try out trousers .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she mut@@ tered , as she saw in it , pulled her out and put her back on the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put it back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had ta@@ sted the under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor she took off a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled off their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discre@@ et place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , and went out and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who could buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how terrible to think that someone would take home with him who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the staff tried to draw clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate going home with a new pair of under@@ pants and finding out that another woman had dressed her and went out and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ e@@ wer around for your rob@@ bers .
when one approaches you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the Line of Fire , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and shoulder , before you hit the face with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with his knee in the body and twist , while the Att@@ acker is bent before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while it direc@@ ts the weapon to him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can not shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to submit your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide@@ book his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went a serious examination of his immune system and thro@@ ws - by making some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k lowered his course on a euro note , a rail@@ ing on the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a washing toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before removing each object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he will get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results .
the thought to lick the sink of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact , in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria are located .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left him to lick , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and eating odd and wonderful things .
from public money to train stations to flush toilets of toilets , the task assigned to its immune system definitely below a sample
in the film he said : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its finishing line showed a lumin@@ ometric count of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ous number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands had one out of less than 60 .
Mr W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst that I have smoked in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirty than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon .
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in color@@ ect@@ al health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the movie , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instruc@@ ted him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things with which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others , where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey carried out by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys before Del@@ og@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a delay with a damage of £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were viol@@ ently removed from their property , sho@@ cked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls made g@@ aping holes , wooden boards were torn , garbage was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who is working for the Home Office at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a real night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ lic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all sl@@ ats , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ aming , disputes and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be dem@@ ol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the estate in which drugs were negoti@@ ated in the past , the wooden boards were torn open
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to be called up regularly by the police .
Corn@@ wall Housing bag@@ ged her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily undergo .
the dol@@ lies were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said their life was made to Hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived with them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we speak the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could not sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family would have agreed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step of taking into consideration Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who approached us courage@@ ously and gave us the information they have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message convey@@ ed that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation on the floor .
workers of the house management will now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after she had found herself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ y@@ mouth .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will del@@ og@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not comply with the house rules
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall told Angela C@@ row that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who did not comply with the rules of the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self repro@@ ach and to those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal reloc@@ ated to Pan@@ ic after a ti@@ ring military jet over@@ flying the beach
sun worship in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ tive P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces put an incredible dive forward
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no safety haz@@ ard was required
this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtened tourists begin panic after a running jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the sun wor@@ shi@@ ppers on the Av@@ eiro beach section in the north of Portugal .
the tourists j@@ umped when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the jet @-@ drives , without first seeing what came through the clouds to them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro beach were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet was slightly lower than usual due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility due to the bad visibility . however , the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
wild@@ land fires have destroyed these summer parts of the mainland Portugal , where there were also four people who died on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

the dou@@ b@@ ter winner must wai@@ ve the Olympic soccer tournament with the under@@ laid cup@@ fin@@ alist and ruling Europa League Champion among others on Ne@@ y@@ mar , who will compete with the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also , there is also a lack of Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a bend in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete in Barcelona for two years around the status as number one .
coach Luis En@@ rique so far refra@@ ined from making a clear decision , leaving Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining applications .
before the first compulsory game of the new season , the Spanish Master doubts about the fitness level of the team who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
even at the 3 : 2 in the pro@@ visional stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really want to convince .
Sev@@ ille , on the other hand , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
mA Long in its own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Chinese Ma &apos;@@ Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title def@@ ender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Jan@@ eiro in a one @-@ sided finale .
in doing so , the world ranking leader won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at WM , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia .
bronze went to Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title mut@@ ually exclusive .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five Rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
mA and Z@@ hang were left to the plate alone , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs , they had no coaches .
they had with@@ drawn on the tri@@ bun@@ e and left their sho@@ oters in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final , I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts pos@@ ing with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
mA had only to fight with its 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that , he determined the pace at the top and left Z@@ hang , only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the anticipated stir@@ ring match .
nevertheless , there were still enough stunning ball changes to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his quarter @-@ final against the German @-@ champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans suffered a rib@@ bed injury , after that , in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) became Olympic @-@ V@@ ete with similarly high table tennis tables .
Donald Tr@@ ump has dre@@ amt of &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave up short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the present rep@@ ubli@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident multi @-@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed as little concern as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside the rep@@ ubli@@ can camp out of the race , doubts start to grow in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , who he asked for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida and Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bl@@ aming false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his famous media group .
Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds shake
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were consistent with the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the radio station CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump answered the question how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; exactly as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correc@@ tness , that was ok , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not present better survey values .
instead of it the candidates of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger than the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ cky sc@@ am with dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair during the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a trainer at home .
the International Olympic Committee dealt with the establishment of a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function told us that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya &apos;s dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson shared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following IO@@ C measures , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was called IA@@ AF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the control station and worked as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , handed over the trial and signed , &quot; said Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
it was owned by the ac@@ creditation of the ath@@ l@@ ete , who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments sport@@ s@@ men of his country .
according to media reports , he allegedly was arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special surveillance for a long time already in the IO@@ C .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target checks submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Olympics , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics commen@@ ce .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is con@@ form to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most of the medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , alle@@ g@@ ations were raised again and again that in Kenya Dop@@ ing means are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of the sport fraud .
last but not least , IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
it was possible to prove that in this kind of sport it was covered extensively and systematically .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival hosts the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth night@@ mare .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she reminds of melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first of all because it &apos;s musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
she is wise , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character which I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives back the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
it is seen in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a joy@@ ous approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the West Side Story : &quot; this piece deals with pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are just as powerful today as it was at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl , which joined IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from East London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then embar@@ ked on a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ an &apos;s family has been informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , Leader of the Democratic Party in the Senate , is convinced that the pres@@ idency of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Justice Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the late judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulates .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team wouldn &apos;t worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US Court of App@@ eals for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and heroes of Republi@@ can presidential candidates Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated Donald Tr@@ ump was in@@ appropriate for the president &apos;s office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to Calendar to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the magazine &quot; Tre@@ ats Magazin &quot; works with the photographer David Belle@@ mer to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine was distingu@@ ish@@ able from Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys since Play@@ boy was for men . &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently , it is the view that the calendar does also .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community expects mass flight
&quot; those who are not adap@@ ting and Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish congregation of Germany soon reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers escap@@ ing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president of exile Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh accus@@ ation of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand asylum seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government has already crossed Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds for months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing in Turkey .
after put@@ ted put@@ sch , still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks are added .
many will want to start an@@ ew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that pi@@ cks refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the association was in charge of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in Ala@@ evi@@ an cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan would raise the pressure to travel to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the associations called for the German government to position itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics will be held . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ pendant destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who are not adap@@ ting and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular@@ es , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper on appeal to figures by the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks proclaimed the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this would have been 11.@@ 386 people and therefore just under 29 per cent of all recognized claims ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty , or lack of prospects .
asylum rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually prosec@@ uted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals don &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for stupid as far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bit@@ es itself .
the locals , who want to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the holidays in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are on the way , are not locals , so do not choose the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : during holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and end up voices just lab@@ ori@@ ously .
by September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has once again to pass an election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase when you can tell it at all has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U Coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly lag@@ ging behind the CD@@ U .
it is exciting how much Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of a coalition shock .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the land , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the debt of bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have spe@@ eded up the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is probably going to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its nick@@ name , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time , it is the right place to campaign .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel two times to make a major mistake . Merkel &apos;s German election circuit is in the Nor@@ theast .
but the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a pity not to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U disp@@ enses with the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that in the country it is essential that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the wid@@ ths of the country there is hardly any present .
the advice of the CD@@ U election champion Kok@@ ert on his co @-@ workers is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they must go where it does , namely where people are : village festivals , golden marri@@ ages , every birthday celebration has to be used . &quot;
because there is a lot of stake in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of holiday @-@ need and spend their election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is the name of the country president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green electoral campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local vot@@ ers among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hou@@ s@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg @-@ L@@ akes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : Gast@@ stätten suffering from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; they made everything pretty cris@@ p , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet@@ ty gas station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the start of the week until the end of October .
the mutual agreement of those responsible for the construction works will also be praised , for example when it comes to the establishment of vocational training .
since the construction site has been mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ asse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been rev@@ oked , and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg , the traffic situation within the site has relaxed .
the citizens can now turn from the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comforts , &quot; says Florian King , responsible for the traffic management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ str @-@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many ble@@ aches were looking for and rather their Nav@@ i trusted than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks fra@@ yed in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for the exhibition vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who obviously made himself on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been da@@ zz@@ ling two to three times a minute .
the fastest was on the way at 77 mph @-@ kilometers in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales dis@@ bur@@ sts in them leaves anyone looking at them .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are therefore producing for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences .
also at the deal@@ ership Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; maximum slight decline , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; the career prospects are missing . &quot;
the bars are most heavily sha@@ ved along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
that is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue losses he c@@ ited to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road refurb@@ ishment has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for two years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dism@@ iss half of his collabor@@ ators .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dism@@ issed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant otherwise benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now it must also bear the dis@@ advantages resulting from the rehabilitation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous was handled .
G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue .
after all , family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it points to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else nice .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his main client@@ ele returns to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
it is constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terror .
according to the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a toler@@ ant status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the con@@ cili@@ ator .
all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package .
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was in the position of results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; realis@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has given a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced that a new security office should take care of the kn@@ ack of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second trial for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to establish sympathy for terrorist groups under punishment and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be hard points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and requires nothing to do with the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
some of them have a part in themselves : he is planning quick procedures for dep@@ ort@@ ations and more possibilities for incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before dep@@ ortation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and expose them to social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than before - for instance those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally delicate .
some things also seem un@@ audi@@ ble and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated ones - for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the residents of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees .
and things that people were deeply involved could not be cl@@ ung out in election campaign times .
the inner security has moved enor@@ mously .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
over the past few days , between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ner@@ ous argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the Princip@@ al chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the dual nationality .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , too , lab@@ ors for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from the double pass .
we have been discussing the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ charge you is not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional objec@@ tions .
whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be shown .
there is a lot of things inside , which might cause a dispute .
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ claim internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes caution and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen still got off lightly .
in spite of diesel prices , the delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not run in all markets .
in the recall action , vor@@ ti@@ ces are about a term .
Volkswagen starts deliveries in the second half of the year .
despite the diesel aff@@ aires , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer is able to further demonstrate a plus despite the diesel aff@@ aires thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening in Western Europe and loaded the total sales again , as the company announced in the D@@ ax .
in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , the Volkswagen brand sold more than 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent lower than the prior @-@ year period .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries raised almost a sixth .
sales of brand sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a relu@@ ct@@ ance to purchase in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the UK vote for the withdrawal from the EU also explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the gas sc@@ aff@@ aires first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus in beech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the most affected brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen family is still lightly affected by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition reduction of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is found .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales representative from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software ab@@ at@@ ement test .
in Germany alone , Volkswagen is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars had no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after converting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , the car manufacturer is not talking about a &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason are legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported that Volkswagen now weighs its German customers with a guarantee for re@@ assembled diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Ministry of Transport last Monday .
it was confirmed by the Ministry of Transport that this meeting was held .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my investigation commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from it are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power after conversion will not take place any deteri@@ oration and all vehicle values that are relevant to the vehicle have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not what it meant in corporate voy@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the broad term &quot; Guarant@@ ee , &quot; Volkswagen looks at the possibility that for example , customers might come into a workshop for example , half a year after the retro@@ fitting , and this could result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the waste sc@@ andal , resulting in uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as it was said .
this is why VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Raiff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ it@@ ential interest from rich sa@@ vers in future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boss Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or daily money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German banks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Association of German B@@ anks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; store banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as of September , Raiff@@ eisen Bank G@@ mund is calling for this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros to sight deposit accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he tended to be@@ ware 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banking manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put a million Euros for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the poll@@ u@@ ter principle , he now res@@ umes the costs .
to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already seen four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the bank manager .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is causing considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to bear them alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically idle is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
with a penalty of three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People &apos;s and Raiff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay covers for deposits . in addition , competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a client@@ ele that is a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are keeping money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently not known to other banks that charge a replacement for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banken and Raiff@@ eisen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in the wide range .
destination records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
before you ha@@ sten to comment , to ski@@ p it under the p@@ seud@@ onym No An aven@@ ue of men &apos;s medi@@ a@@ eval ages with harsh ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multilingual re @-@ emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all fores@@ ight according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oho , wearing a humble gray suit and stu@@ ffed wil@@ dly before I stand , keep my hands and say something better as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ ho@@ s slowly closes to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there is still a handful of fantastic table specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already treasure , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought were too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy back their old records .
from the conversations I have led , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phon@@ ica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took advantage of the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to re@@ tire to the stability of familiar disc gro@@ mm@@ ets , from objects that ev@@ oke happy childhood memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned , as I was pu@@ zz@@ ling through a pile of bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of people : three middle aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ val .
&quot; someone came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Sonic plate so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ laden , less musi@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in only slowly .
F@@ allo@@ p , which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ @-@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging mental trau@@ mas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale .
it makes more of a window shopping than a wholesale purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve a lot , so collecting disks is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of disks is ... &quot; it drives off with a fallen si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record holders : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to show the je@@ ans pants for je@@ ans , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing themselves together for a moment about Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ ho@@ s for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one most suitable for luxury items such as panels .
even though my research has yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in record shops in S@@ oho , have not taken into account the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people are probably working hard in school or in offices .
they will certainly not spend their Thursday morning with the bum@@ bling through plates shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while avoiding the star@@ ry view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who rises over the shoulders of none of the middle @-@ aged men .
the Greenland shar@@ k is the longest living verteb@@ rate - video face
scientists say that the Greenland shar@@ k has the longest li@@ fes@@ pan of all verteb@@ rates on the planet .
Julius Niel@@ sen , the shar@@ k investig@@ ates , says that the record was with a female , from which it is assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long .
French Court ref@@ uses offers about demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
at a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to tear 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the warehouse sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid , and that could pose a risk of fire and health .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also learned that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary trades , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that grocery stores , cafés and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed only people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas provide quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the Camp , which is shared use and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as an advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those children of a disaster , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers during the summer .

he had to analyse the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

consolidated start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people playing video games is a giant thing - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which speci@@ alizes in this hobby .
Microsoft on Thursday did not share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started off with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene yourself .
for example , they can give up missions to players and counter@@ pose enemies as well as provide equipment .
the Spiel@@ eri@@ ese Ac@@ ti@@ vision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook should help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the associates at the start @-@ up , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , move to the Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i ha@@ iled .
for the customers , nothing should change through the tak@@ eover .
according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video game department all around the Xbox console .
the live streaming market of video games continues to grow rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was bought by online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation of speed kni@@ ves : in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be effectively transferred to Temp@@ os@@ ün@@ de .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary speed limits , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary bl@@ itz to comply with the speed limit .
but a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days in continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across multiple tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as transit messages according to time , travel and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly experienced condition you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ utter@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also bl@@ ur with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ year rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ year rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ od@@ oro stage here in Rio .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ st@@ eppe , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on it in the final .
but regardless of it , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago she was lost under Ryan &apos;s play at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this fla@@ p will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and had fun boun@@ cing G@@ Bs .
it felt for captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze in the corner .
with four minutes of playing time Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a pen@@ ultimate T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mount of men Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a went down a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still a minute of playing time ... in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anian gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through the brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ inging and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ e .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ ff sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB was kno@@ cking anni@@ hil@@ ating in the la@@ wns .
earlier this day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa into a scar@@ ce half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a score among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the British 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for a stroke victory
there will be no more em@@ ble@@ matic gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first ru@@ dder to the last 220 hard p@@ ieve that go into history Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those two sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when she ro@@ de for the second Olympics ag@@ old in a second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that made such a measure .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 39.@@ 95 failed bet , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances the right term is at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts came to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked for me .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better trainer or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 metres , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , p@@ anning and glob@@ es had too much in reserve .
we were caught very much at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something ra@@ bies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear on a wedding next week , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity provided for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring .
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exemplary . &quot;
a small drinking water dispens@@ er as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago in the original sound it was a part of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia government dig@@ ged the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe applied to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a member of the company for 31 years , has been Managing Director for 28 years .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe with its headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , community Breit@@ brunn , supports about 15@@ 0,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the municipalities Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for further cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the Zw@@ eck@@ enst@@ andes in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency revenues on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the renovation of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stag@@ nation and I have always added new improvements because water is the most important food for drinking water and drinking water .
in her lau@@ dat@@ ory speech she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose @-@ association and he lived the water @-@ purpose @-@ association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practi@@ tioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe on the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia .
for that he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised the water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water atten@@ d@@ ant and he was a faithful cra@@ p .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ construction and restructuring of the co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve association .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the pit stop at the high reservoir near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3 .
here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water .
the supply of Neu@@ brunn can also be maintained only because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man killed his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday and wounded her to death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after which he is publicly tra@@ pped .
now nation@@ wide , because Sven S. might be on the road with the car .
the man is approximately 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown burned and has a gloss .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the man is wearing a roller .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , the police .
anyone who sees Sven S. should call 110 .
the police talk about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially didn &apos;t want to give information about the ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ ri@@ um . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not saying more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operational command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
STAHL - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial bur@@ dens which are threatened by the sector from the green electricity promotion are from the table .
the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) , when it comes to the release of renewable energies in the German steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to use steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with the Com@@ miss@@ ary Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for generating electricity .
with this , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation there are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure .
last year , the situation became more acute than the world &apos;s largest producer in China cast steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers accused Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
over the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties have effect on import steel , and on the other hand the economic prospects in China have been bri@@ ghtened .
it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would rather have stag@@ n@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp last but not least wanted to exclude the closures of individual works .
around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced amount went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an improved order situation in the coming months thanks to an increase in orders .
community , Spirit , Health : singing does senior citizens good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and altogether more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good with her health and spirit .
for S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to leave on the other and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive way , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for the elderly , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the powder in everyday life too .
even if it &apos;s about getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
elderly people often have a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association of the Sen@@ iors @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
due to lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers suffer from long back events .
in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz .
concent@@ rating simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the feeling of self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I do long for something , I become better and wa@@ ver beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing is enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing men , who h@@ ears when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior male , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the area .
whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior cho@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research .
those who like to sing should definitely join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers to the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect is the calling of litter b@@ umps on adult animals .
to their surprise the male did not let the males cold - however they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens in the eyes of the little ones .
they respond ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who have found themselves in great need , as scientists have found out by the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly created young for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult male and eight female males were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of MH@@ H .
they were pre@@ played by little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised .
the researchers hold their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker , when this call was played by the very much more excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be connected or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , no matter if they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ß is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ß .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match will take place in Turkey .
ahead of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the fall of the state of emergency in July .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
it doesn &apos;t stop before football too .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ß , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
according to this , the South East , who is now living in America , is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ß is said to be a follo@@ wer of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup d &quot; é@@ tat by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency ex@@ pi@@ red initially for 90 days is still valid until October , actually this has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas Workers &quot; Club are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
however , in view of dramatic experiences in history , the groove of the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; award , it will be particularly likely to arrive on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne in the past season proved its sporting value : with 17 fo@@ ols and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as a top sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final match against fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; F@@ AN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; went out early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ schüt@@ z @-@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , which was under contract with the AC , was only announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ man F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to do so , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to for@@ go about a third of his annual salary estimated to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals for Olympic Games in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other trans@@ national athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio .
the subject of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swimming teacher Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who compl@@ ained about her right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly pl@@ ast@@ ered and burned at her start ( 100 meters breast ) .
it was a bizarre scene : she was still in the hall with a sm@@ iling smile and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was established that they would not get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ ble storm .
but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing history at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and former world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to ab@@ ort a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after it was detected by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ done .
she had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery , and the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion from 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ kovic was taking the wis@@ ely dose and was locked for six months .
the four wid@@ est lit@@ ters this year are on the account of the Big Golden fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Rel@@ ay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and has been locked for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , em@@ powered Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ l@@ ete had so many medals in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after obtaining testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European Championships because of testosterone mis@@ use .
the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games also returned to CAS due to a verdi@@ ct of the International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a banned food supplement were found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and went on on the 13th of July .
Bom@@ b@@ ent@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the State Department , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I could leave it again .
her journey home I planned for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are affected , be not yet un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life district .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported from Ph@@ uk@@ et in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coast .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g at the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast requested several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express themselves with possible motives - but probably these are the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sabot@@ age restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities had kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and places .
it is still un@@ clear which group is behind the attacks .
police instruc@@ ted their officials throughout the country to rein@@ force security related to major government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amus@@ ement quarters .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the latest bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after cl@@ ashes between the security forces and the Muslim populations , there is no need to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the jun@@ ta .
this will give the military a big influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country turns towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces , re@@ affir@@ med themselves to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for many years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is aimed at the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several regional offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also made the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; identity movement &quot; indications for as@@ pi@@ rations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aßen , the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants of Islamic faith , or from the Middle East , are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - are already observing the &quot; identity . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely aligned with the authorities in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &quot; identity movement &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court Chief .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with adol@@ escent language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the active Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are vulnerable in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , there were reports on contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from several federal states to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said he had no knowledge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on whether the party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view to the significant increase of legitimate off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee accommodations , Ma@@ ate said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this regard .
but in recent years we have found that there can be a right @-@ wing terrorist structure .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m motives .
however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rec@@ u@@ per@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ate expressed concern about the fact that many enc@@ ro@@ achments went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying factor .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts that may have been politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who then radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist senti@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or world records set the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courage@@ ous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro &apos;s summer games .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia went so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was then used as an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries well known .
since most sport@@ s@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media called him &quot; Ro@@ bel der W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he first struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle , did not play any role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el have also been drawn .
during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the swimming pool &apos;s appearance from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ rene@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old got to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the threatening constitu@@ ency of elections so narrow
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is talking on an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then drives into the holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump is losing the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either work or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it did not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correc@@ tness , that was ok , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he signed the US President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the IS terrorist mili@@ tia ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post climb@@ s into the trade with electric transp@@ orts
an electric delivery vehicle of the German Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously large .
the Post is planning to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
shortly , the Group wants to start trading with the transp@@ orter .
the Post is planning to offer its electric vehicles in the free car market from next year onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether it is intended to sell its self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be sold to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ des had said there are always ques@@ tioning , for example by craftsmen .
following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly .
in post@@ production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group intends to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and deliver a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very tough step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we complete the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
fi@@ bre@@ glass leadership resig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the re@@ treats came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uns@@ af@@ e , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ences at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the resig@@ nation of corporate management , the global number Five of the industry faces a new beginning .
at the end of the year , G@@ FR@@ P Executive Board wants to leave the company .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
as of September 1 , the Executive Board of Management Board of Management , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , transferred the company to the Executive Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be the market research company in future , is still uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in investor relations it was said on Friday that the shareholders last year saw the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ Spitze since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , each stock@@ holders will eventually become uns@@ ett@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that was the case with BMW , this would also make the odds &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company won &apos;t be able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the same period of the previous year .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros were shr@@ inking by 3.4 per cent .
earnings in the second quarter imp@@ acted above all the decline in value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company &apos;s business value depreci@@ ation , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , reported a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million to the Group under the line .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight Ver@@ ses
eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hearing ( District of Aur@@ ich ) when an accident involving 43 elderly passengers was reported .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , told the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specification , had to ev@@ ade a truck that was partly on the counter .
the bus stopped right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police , Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund , reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance coach came to the place of accidents on the provincial road 2 .
the last passengers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ophone district of Pe@@ w@@ sum by a bus bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the lor@@ ry and possible witnesses to report to the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic meter of wast@@ ewater will be 3.@@ 44 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( now 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater charge will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the wast@@ ewater price in Az@@ endorf will be 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the budget was approved by the Council of Agriculture , Kul@@ mb@@ ach found that covers were running for these wast@@ ewater facilities .
due to legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ effectively .
from October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let .
fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt indicated the Board , a new calculation of the fees for sewage installations in the market community was necessary .
in the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - and over@@ l@@ app@@ ings from the previous calculation period are to be compens@@ ated .
the gra@@ vi@@ fying fee increases were explained by Schmidt that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water drop in all three sewage installations with a very low waste of waste water , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution of distribution , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the underlying calculation period of all three systems , not least because of their age , rehabilitation and repair costs have fallen into a considerable extent .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water system Az@@ endorf due to damage .
the pump@@ ing station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl had to be over@@ hau@@ led for almost 20 years , and after nearly 20 years the first sewage treatment plant had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the ongoing support and maintenance costs that should be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that at the low waste of wast@@ ewater in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market town of large entertainment costs in the wast@@ ewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed .
according to stone houses , the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned systems will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ ous , as one cannot bro@@ aden the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater station around these plants , because these are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as a positive 0.2 % have been posted .
the annual average annual inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .

Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on critici@@ zed
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is non@@ sensi@@ cal to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already ad@@ joining to the absurd .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are non @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded , self @-@ locking tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ si@@ les reach the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have attracted criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested to some users a filter that gave them mud eyes , false teeth and angry che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if this repeated contro@@ vers@@ y had pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and indig@@ nation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely spread about the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and mil@@ dly said was unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not uns@@ ec@@ ured , but that the yellow face has been pulled down into the down@@ ward extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company to cross this cultural pride .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is ins@@ ul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account while others insi@@ sted on doing the same thing .
in an ess@@ ay for media and a telephone interview , she said she believes that ra@@ cial contro@@ vers@@ y reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part of white , only male leadership and ended her ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either she doesn &apos;t have any representation of people with other skin colours in her workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to tell . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a person responsible to focus on under@@ represented populations and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said she will close her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it &apos;s not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence intelligence , establishes con@@ gres@@ sional committee
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on site allowed , an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Army Com@@ mitt@@ ees , Secret Service Com@@ mitt@@ ees and the Army Com@@ mitt@@ ees , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Key service anal@@ ysts who reported how superi@@ ors altered their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence gathering information typically enjoyed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders marked a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , noted .
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how anal@@ ysts faced pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ s@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that anal@@ ysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be comple@@ mented by more detailed information while the investigations are continued .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway due to the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com has created an excessive process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest @-@ level democra@@ t in the committee , member of the Adam B. Schiff &apos;s House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged morality among anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for different opinions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention at Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts in terms of a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the con@@ gresses were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon In@@ spec@@ tor , which was taken up following complaints by Cent@@ Com anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of Congress while the investig@@ ators of the general inspec@@ tor are still in progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations lead to re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of the past year have raised the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminiscent of tens of thousands more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and did little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker determined that against the statements of the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these pro@@ visional refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the Leg@@ is@@ l@@ ative for his excessive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not part of the people who keep their gates in memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are alike in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which will remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will each receive the first and second place each .
the first place will take the strong Dutch girl a little longer from the path that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , Americans have prov@@ oked a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey club in his hands for the first time at three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we didn &apos;t have the working @-@ house in London , which we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been able to pull out the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ rows in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the close range .
India had gone into the game without a victory , but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who until now had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympics , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro feel constant and in@@ escap@@ able , a swi@@ ft relay race between competition and quest .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning stick that is passed by the w@@ rist@@ bands to the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bal@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the conflict between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to the Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ enc@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic Tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame never lights up every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
but if I can mo@@ dest@@ ly make arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many of whom I had asked , didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an ath@@ l@@ ete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a clo@@ wn school as those for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical cit@@ tern of his never @-@ ending boun@@ ce - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports which it essentially un@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are rated according to the official Olympic program according to the specification , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they chase not only the finish line or the output wall , but also another highlight in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympic ord .
the pur@@ pos@@ eful pur@@ suit is noble , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir one viewer to tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed myself while watching these games .
the trampoline offers an atmosphere of breathing .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline ring is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be .
the women &apos;s qualification and final hours will take place on Friday afternoon in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end @-@ hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00 .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts had recently hit according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are pushing for violent resistance from the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses testi@@ fied that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with polic@@ emen .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanded into more and more regions .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was mer@@ cil@@ ess .
witnesses testi@@ fied that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on an un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation , videos on the protests which are probably from the last or early this year show how security officers hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , in particular in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a substantial pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the v@@ ast@@ ness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options apart from prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lectur@@ er in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth prot@@ ested .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the ruling coalition .
following a widespread choice last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time tensions continue along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
anal@@ ysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who have been more or less en@@ forced in recent years , explo@@ de the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de under the surface after years of wor@@ sen@@ ing .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially with protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are no natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are mainly Christian high @-@ states from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special mand@@ ates to process opponents and to make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime l@@ acks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
in contrast to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al was 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to the data of anal@@ ysts seemed to be mis@@ led by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of distur@@ ban@@ ces went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , and their measur@@ able progress in fighting poverty .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ mis@@ e of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ic city , headed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is more and more common in the social media .
anal@@ ysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim that Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last contro@@ vers@@ y that surro@@ unds his campaign by fear@@ ing that his multiple re @-@ asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
it also brings out his co @-@ workers who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of declar@@ ing statements that he could not have meant .
having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump resi@@ ded in terms of the alle@@ g@@ ation on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling fra@@ ctions on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump once again tried to return to this issue .
speaking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Natur@@ ally , I mean the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; as the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his say@@ ings v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leading edge in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is increasingly focusing on the attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors of Tr@@ ump@@ et , made a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said he was ques@@ tioning the correc@@ tness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back banks , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread by blocking the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump res@@ um@@ ed his attacks on the media and accused them of riding on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he scor@@ ned the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats compl@@ ained about Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s excuse as only a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the president &apos;s office .
once displac@@ ed by the market , Café entered Green@@ point
ver@@ b Cafe was a big@@ amy coffee shop in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices were pushed out of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , which made Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people scre@@ wed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ B@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluding and ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , it is also new finding .
a revi@@ ved ver@@ b cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displac@@ ed by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a client .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and regularly visited the club .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take her way .
after the ver@@ b had closed she gave up coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was coffee and culture in the ver@@ b that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addi@@ tive .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I arrived quarter after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal always gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment in the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he is going to exhibit it soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands onto a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plenti@@ ful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had lunch at the Oval Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ acies on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a little more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding as dessert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they met with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , straightforward snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since stock crash in 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive piece , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
as the rep@@ orter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple suitable for discussion about food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver lo@@ af and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male rim and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; draws the ways in which the country was going to be no longer the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e announced why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ get@@ diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man , since chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ ene luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy cooking .
while resear@@ ching the book that includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that era , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addi@@ tive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - adapted the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary polic@@ y@@ makers , &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa peasant &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ ends like a million@@ aire man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked a continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was a glorious stranger .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt would have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to rep@@ ay an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper has no interest in flavors by Ms. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food has been disc@@ arded as soon as the country has returned to its legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to foods .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag @-@ incident .
after the plates at Eis@@ enberg were cleared , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the president Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt did eat at lunch .
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to miss a modest recipe .
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed relu@@ ct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ get@@ ary he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved the life of just under 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game in order to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil servant , showing him a 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the figure : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die in saving lives , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adia area , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland shar@@ ks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
born in 16@@ 24 , it flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ ks only get offspring with 150 years .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in one hour it comes in average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it depends , the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal will speed up to a full 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
but this lifestyle shaped by slo@@ wn@@ ess seems to be a patent recipe for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Greenland shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments on this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
indeed , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist predicted that Greenland will grow stone .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland shar@@ ks are hard to observe , after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland shar@@ ks .
she measured six animals with a transmitter prior to S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , the shar@@ ks make this shar@@ k : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt asleep animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ so from higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland shar@@ ks , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the biggest was 502 centi@@ meters .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s , when a nuclear weapons investigation carried out large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centi@@ meters in length , the l@@ enti@@ cular core , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all the larger Greenland shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens core , resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ metre @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old with 502 centi@@ meters .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign the length to an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coinci@@ dence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland wh@@ ale , whose bacon at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on spar@@ ks .
so they mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses warmth .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
building plot in double pack
the Municipal Council has focused on topics related to construction in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel adopted the announcement of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported housing areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the development , par@@ enting and development issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ wal@@ k@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße ) is no longer in the way to interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ sty elderly alike .
as it was said , building volunteers can immediately report to the town hall , and the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September session .
the Municipal Council decided to change the newly created land use plan in sub @-@ sections only in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ install@@ lar@@ n area , the industrial area already designated there is expanded by two plots towards the state road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the City of the Main therefore has the best chances of attra@@ cting reloc@@ ated jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt is most benef@@ iting from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence Board of Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether banks will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
to date , the so @-@ called EU passport is enough for them to be approved in the United Kingdom .
this is making use of large US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to reloc@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comp@@ utes with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the biggest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority EI@@ O@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it also cuts down the infrastructure of the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
in addition , the city uses readily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
Frankfurt also offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is on the seventh place , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on the 37@@ th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IC@@ W conclu@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the econom@@ ists think .
the balance of forces also expressed : in London , according to figures by Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people were working in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt they were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US @-@ based judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a claim for damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after an American judge discovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck including the per@@ fi@@ ance and other un@@ ethical acts .
in case of charging the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. counter@@ party Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead has claimed the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead that domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained to each other and took over property on laboratory work , including So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in Gilead &apos;s medicines .
U.S. supported troops say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the United States backed the full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , said a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are now comb@@ ing the city after the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the remaining group of fighters who have du@@ g themselves within the city .
they liber@@ ated more than 2,000 civilians who were held as host@@ ages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared with the D@@ KS Con@@ feder@@ ate Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are performing clearing up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday , which gave the Democrats candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the State Department .
Clin@@ tons candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ AN from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declar@@ ations for the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; gave Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a position .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ tors in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not oblig@@ ated to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated a tax check by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the Democratic candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump@@ et Special Advisor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax inspec@@ tions are not completed .
Tr@@ ump@@ et critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his refusal issues questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other compounds , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asked to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she also talked about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other candidate has done during the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump had paid no or only very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton is supporting a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the vot@@ ers and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has published a tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that these were only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in humans inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ tin .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , intensi@@ fied its promotion together with the US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without inf@@ ring@@ ing animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the Day of World Ph@@ ones , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; commented the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ illi @-@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned towards the f@@ lin@@ t .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ tin into the air .
a touch is usually already out to chase the elephant .
a last option is a thro@@ wer that sho@@ ots a fire@@ works fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
town coun@@ cill@@ or unanim@@ ously decided : no ki@@ os@@ kne@@ ad@@ au at St. Go@@ ddess Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar investment projects of commercial traders are taking part in K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - even retail in the core city is considered to be significantly expanding .
the City Council , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new building of a sal@@ oon on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ gold building in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically we welcome new traders , but at this location in the exposed position on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director crus@@ hes Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election after &quot; Arab &quot; aff@@ or@@ estation has been removed - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli presidential election , as Arab guests would have requested an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bri@@ stol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the list of countries of the hotel .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ si Bri@@ stol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
the reason behind this was even more rage in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is wi@@ ped out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was c@@ ited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ blatt called this a &quot; big dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recre@@ ated &quot; the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly showed all accus@@ ations about themselves and called the incident a &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
adds that the country code has been added .
police force tear gas &amp; rubber floors against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazilian city , together with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police attacked tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which caused the police to insert rubber floors and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters tried to spray gra@@ ff@@ iti against the pro@@ visional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dism@@ issed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eh@@ ran grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies has been growing strongly in shops in the country , the ambassador agreed .
Russian companies are taking up existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading volume between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade recovery was reached by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
for this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian Foreign Office issued around 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily the travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d that have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl over@@ alls
a rob@@ ber@@ y case has been carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ger Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the presence of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces demanded the issu@@ ing of cash from the employees of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share .
the perpet@@ rators were supposed to have been between 1,60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the park deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the perpet@@ rators must be tra@@ vers@@ ed towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel car park in front of the car park entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of action ( at 19.@@ 45 am ) who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y case should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun at summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ ago@@ gic group / social group work of the child protection federation Nag@@ old with their car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers on their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
the life @-@ loving group was quar@@ rel@@ ed during the first week of school in the quiet Frei@@ ges@@ theim Hard@@ t@@ opp@@ dle .
several full day trips stood on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .

on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and planning .
culinary del@@ ights were given to children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers with their own food , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops was made , beautiful gem@@ s made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot;
on the day of the journey home the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were dealt with together .
in order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stri@@ es in two years , the Council of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage objectives were examined and the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg was finally decided , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the portal of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 And Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the saints , arose .
in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims to St. Anna in a small ceremony , blessed pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and shared the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b , we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Our Lady &apos;s wife and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was ki@@ cked off from Münster .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening with a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the min@@ is@@ ers on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeat@@ ed@@ ely made R@@ ast to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
the parish offices of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
on the destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller took care of a tasty and forti@@ fying dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ t@@ wan@@ gen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , had to desc@@ end approximately 500 metres altitude at first , and then climbed again afterwards .
the deser@@ ved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , it went on the closing stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met at Freiburg &apos;s Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the portal of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed here .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert , who arrived at the evening Mass in Münster , was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day there was time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong communal experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite Gold wins for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
Glas@@ gow &apos;s 23 @-@ year @-@ old took the anchor role he had made to his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the J@@ äger@@ und made the legend hau@@ gh@@ ty when he stor@@ med home to conquer New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the resig@@ nation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in good time as a Hin@@ derer .
Gary &apos;s retirement convinced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man they stayed with when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots that has developed .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who were winning with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner won a qualifying race in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner stopped it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation running in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am just here to do my best and make a name for myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and the world champion was defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di admitted that after a weak start he was inten@@ tionally falling on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no ob@@ jection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a supreme victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is in the area of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
this would mean Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
that would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the spr@@ int , which will start today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this just for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ kilometer racing .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
yesterday he had argued with representatives prior to the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of medals .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
they played Dra@@ mas in the background , so the resig@@ nation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of S@@ BB and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ kö@@ ping as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which at the perfect moment reached its climax , will be repeated .
future of the melt of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus raises the supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy specified for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks losing .
this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting mill with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; that should come into force from November 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracts have a period of 12 months , so they will end in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L revenues from G@@ J 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L stated that the value of the contracts had already been depreci@@ ated in the amount of $ 187 million in anticip@@ ation of termination .
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; does not imp@@ air .
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force from November this year even if there is still a statement to why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , anal@@ ysts warn of the possible closure of Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , the head of operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume about 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year and Tom@@ ato around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity annually .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator this would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran to the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ like ? ) , scre@@ ened reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show biz new@@ com@@ ers and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this is the stere@@ otyp@@ ed act of almost every birthday sep@@ tic of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on@@ ist on a slot at 8 am ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , security began a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
K@@ end@@ alls &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West had to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , 6@@ 15 pages of the Wäl@@ zers are 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover star is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still perme@@ ated before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to shoot a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always something ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret Model Stephan@@ ie Sey@@ m@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her the mi@@ st@@ let@@ ins of the moment . &quot;
these feelings turned up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but riding on the mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all of her sisters will sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made images of Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal Centre Centr@@ es annually reject 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s assistance centers are rejected annually by the municipal control centres , while the industry is taking a look at the impact of further central cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and similar - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly eff@@ ected , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s municipal centre centers said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Executive Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dism@@ issed each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without a postpon@@ ement of the Federal Government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s congreg@@ ations are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people from important services you need will be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and crus@@ hing debts , families who have been dism@@ issed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
from June 2017 , the German government will sh@@ orten the means by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance .
we call on the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign charged after employees allegedly drew weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s campaign has been charged with alleged in@@ action after she was told that in February , her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on a staff while they were in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident was described in an indictment , submitted by Vincent Bord@@ ini on Wednesday , a former software progra@@ mmer for the campaign in this state .
Bord@@ ini admitted to have waited for months that the matter would be internally regulated before he realised that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
the leader of the campaign , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; Bord@@ ini gave in his indictment .
after compl@@ ying with the local and regional campaign leadership , Bord@@ ini stated that at least four more persons had made the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bord@@ ini added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a ri@@ ot when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected .
Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s campaign made it clear that the media would have torn his words from the context and that he would not viol@@ ate violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint calls for damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage .
Tr@@ ump@@ et press spokes@@ woman Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip did fail .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are distinguished .
this gave representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , it is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good chances to continue to head to the head of the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 per cent , five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just scar@@ cely ahead of the CD@@ U , which could again rise to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens remained in the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses at 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , according to the survey , the survey was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pir@@ ates would not miss the entry in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator has been on the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors are domin@@ ating the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes initially , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
the Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator came to stores exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros , lovers can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ Net Valley .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the western pocket format . &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible by HTML browsers , al@@ beit slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile business sector experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
the market today is dominated by providers who came all much later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , everything is easy to use via touch screen .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had a look at .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German today looks back 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to put the smartphone aside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Kugel , responsible for personnel at the Siemens Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new jobs alone , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the dou@@ b@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in weather @-@ like growth and bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and Mouse Game &quot; about Ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age , a &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; is the same .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertis@@ ements on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the en@@ coding for its advertis@@ ements to make it more difficult to detect the recognition of what part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the flag@@ ging open source community and the conver@@ sions has been underway since the invention of scor@@ eboard readers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embar@@ ked on the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying sign @-@ makers have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people worldwide use indicators ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
the company has said that mobile ad recor@@ ders have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , sharing a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worthwhile investing in such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences &quot; in order to give people more control over the ads they have received .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ Blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man for Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we instead focus on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls on witnesses after a woman was passed on a motorway at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles in the early morning hours on Thursday .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman wanted to kill herself at the age of 49 , which was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a truck .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , who requested them and every witness of the incident to report themselves .
an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes said Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a coll@@ ision avoi@@ dable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ e@@ woman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after having passed and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was un@@ conscious in the street , took the court .
the court stated that the polic@@ e@@ woman -- who responded to a call -- went to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ ee@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA climate model : Venus once inhabited
according to projections of a new NA@@ SA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have referred to similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still rot@@ ated slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this he@@ ats the surface and produces ra@@ inf@@ all that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution , which was previously thought by planet scientists .
although suppos@@ edly hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from the ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen just escaped a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy re@@ tires as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy returned to Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che as trainer and vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations at Thursday , leading to low co @-@ determination in the team decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations , Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy expressed himself in a position .
during the summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick kept me informed of this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season , Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the two last years the post@@ season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell back five points behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two tunes with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North C@@ ee@@ ee@@ pers res@@ ume talks , set strikes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles for re@@ mun@@ eration for the North Sea workers are suspended , while all parties oppose the table for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , which are run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group as well as the UN@@ ites and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a number of full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start next year in order to restart the problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its contra@@ c@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company expects a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company provide the required space in order to get through the market sl@@ ump .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ collaboration with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea are expected in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates and in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary emergence .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancers , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light years distant from the Earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these win@@ ches travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star ages , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the P@@ lei@@ adian Ballet we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Star H@@ alls of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , When and Why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; hang up .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional withdrawal notice , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to both , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Duel@@ ist of the Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 counts for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he has been able to earn some mil@@ estones .
with Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two bas@@ eb@@ all players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the bas@@ eb@@ all hall .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is its occurrence outside the square .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; to have taken banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 .
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received high @-@ performance funds through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the ban was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days do not run no@@ is@@ elessly .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends have once again received the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who had been married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and had the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy @-@ testimon@@ ies by the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen &apos;s Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want a @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .

Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a skilled ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meters obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ eko@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already cri@@ tically @-@ du@@ sty athle@@ tics competitions this news came to an end .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was already proven last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked drug for dop@@ ing substances .

on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses over 50 m Freestyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) filed an application for the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires a message from Ch@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Court of Sport and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also at the night of Rio the news spread over the positive trial at Dan@@ eko@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O should act in the forbidden substance .
for the time being , thanks to B@@ NT , the B sample should also be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v contacted the ath@@ l@@ ete immediately with criticism of the ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation cannot participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon for three days .
both of them deny the consumption , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , especially the case of Dan@@ ko@@ wa is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation IA@@ AF had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad until an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , as well as the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China had caused violent confron@@ tations also between the athletes .
so Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ ass .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Freestyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also focused on a confron@@ tation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing dec@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun was tested positive for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din by the Chinese Championships , but only had to ab@@ ort a three @-@ month lock .
media lau : so per@@ fi@@ de @-@ presses h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programm@@ ers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey by the malware gun specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were once the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims will@@ ingly paid the sol@@ vent demanded by the perpet@@ rators to be able to use the attacked systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators are increasingly speci@@ alizing in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be ex@@ tor@@ ed falls considerably higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski talking to the &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most malware programs were designed to send advertis@@ ements .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first , private users were the goal , but the change to corporate attacks happened quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ ma@@ vers .
in order to get the final key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake for private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production shut down .
the damage is correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 per cent of affected German companies reported sales losses through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in which case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers it is difficult to reject the call of the perpet@@ rators in the face of stag@@ nation in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure Security Studies analysed the user &apos;s space and contact with the black@@ ma@@ ids and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are in fact trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , create freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t example files for free .
and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to return their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the programm@@ ers sell their damage software then in the form of a software package to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits were created by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ids are then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set of a criminal and ask another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per certified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware using file back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful edi@@ fication , the perpet@@ rators are now threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
in this way , the potential for damage depending on the type of data is still much higher than before .
in future , the perpet@@ rators could take entirely new targets on the internet of things in the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the cul@@ pr@@ its then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coupé and even the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V acts rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear , there is no place in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage .
there is not only a trunk of 45@@ 3 l available , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like k@@ itt@@ les and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment is well loaded , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do some qui@@ eter work .
the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is gra@@ ti@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; version , the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City @-@ emergency braking system ( working at speeds 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot;
the remote lighting assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent Temp@@ or@@ eg@@ ler respon@@ ds to the recognition of traffic signs and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed as required .
but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B- and one HDMI ports lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
engines meet Euro 6 emissions standard .
Honda offers a versatile and everyday car with the HR @-@ V .
Air@@ line does not ad@@ here : fall at the passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is conceivable only in case of haz@@ ards that are typical of aviation .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the organiz@@ er pay
ill holi@@ day@@ makers get only money after their trip if the cause of the disease can be found without a doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of a negoti@@ ated case , a family was seriously ill in diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their birthday .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the holi@@ day@@ makers to a defective sewage treatment plant that suppos@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family was the opinion that the trip had been defici@@ ent - and compl@@ ained against the organiz@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment was in fact defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before he left .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus the judgment .
because no imp@@ urities were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion - belongs to the general life risk .
out of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the atro@@ cities committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have been worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined to react at the same time to counter @-@ terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe is : our country will not answer the violence perpet@@ rators of hatred and cle@@ av@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to terrorists .
if off@@ ences would have to leave the country faster , the security and strength also increase the approval of the people for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is aiming to implement proposals to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium four @-@ digit size over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy advertising for terrorism must be under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance should be improved , and the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire will be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet will be ham@@ pered .
the last , much discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors should be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the danger of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the deployment of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister spoke clearly against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is constitu@@ tionally problematic for a general ban on full @-@ veil .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses to court .
Simone Peter , a green @-@ boss , accused the minister that he wanted to simul@@ ate action and action with an ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fle@@ et fleet and a sharpen@@ ing of the right to stay bring people in this country no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bre@@ eder
it st@@ umps regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the balance of law shall be prolonged .
this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the roads every night in traffic when they travel across the motorway from Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state @-@ owned road building is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Road and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ hand lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is divided early , which improves overall production on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district representative Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder makes drivers nervous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge crosses the Alber@@ go and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle post on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is guided only one @-@ lane by the motorway bridge .
the second trail had to be built back a few years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge could no longer have the necessary load , in order to absorb heavy load traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will last , the competent regional company cannot say .
however , with years to be reck@@ oned , the bridge has an official residual service life up to 20@@ 34 .
the state company deliberately chose the traffic weaker time during the school holidays for the extension of the legal agreement , because with disabilities to be expected .
traffic will be run on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Journey : culture offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , initiated by the N@@ ima association , 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the production in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the students of the class are from September 2015 to March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , the press release of the youth theatre Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s association , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ yer , and the Junge Theater will work together as part of a music theatre project in the coming season .
between October and December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language delivery are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the increased number of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes wanting to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on Friday a line by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ scales are Persian , which with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the quick@@ est shooting stars .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east .
rest@@ ful night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , morning is already far from the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleeping problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Schla@@ ef@@ or@@ cism and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , an in- and through @-@ sleep @-@ disorder .
Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , a member of the Executive Board of the German Association of Internal Medicine with Practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el , has just experienced the diar@@ rho@@ ea .
what is behind sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also pharmaceuticals .
in@@ frequently sleeping disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common especially in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , wo@@ ke up every two to three hours and may possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces go to the doctor ?
if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day , consult your doctor .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or even medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine in Germany , says Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep @-@ medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why one should first contact the GP in case of sleeping problems .
it can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens ?
for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors recommend snor@@ ing , for example , with snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in case of illness of the day , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ bon@@ net explains .
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the c@@ abling , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one we@@ ars a nose e@@ ye@@ wear , a chest strap and a probe at the finger .
a camera also records the sleeping place on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few screws which can be used for better sleep .
on the other hand , it counts : regular sleep and rest periods , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , avoid drinking alcohol and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is completely and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .

the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time at the world championships in Doh@@ a . at the same time he set up his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has cont@@ em@@ plate his ex @-@ team @-@ mate in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 Euros and a jungle King 15@@ 0,000 € shouldn &apos;t be surprised by missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday night .
the pump@@ ing system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look as closely as dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported to Germany ( NA@@ DA ) nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
that is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent inspec@@ tors of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream par@@ lor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : pack of luggage racks det@@ ained
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and baggage theft as a band .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a band known to the police from past rob@@ ber@@ y delic@@ acies .
since mid @-@ July this year , the two women and two men had committed several crimes and were jointly , work@@ able and especially professional .
the Speci@@ alists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat , 34 , can demonstrate four acts to the Di@@ vers , who entered Germany specifically for off@@ setting criminal off@@ ences .
in the process , they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a couple of lin@@ den trees , in between still another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in looks not like this , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes some play@@ grounds , a freshly painted nur@@ sery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl that will soon be dem@@ ol@@ ished , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017 .
articles about this &quot; trendy city district , &quot; as adverti@@ sed as the appropriate real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , are preferred by burning cars in the last few weeks .
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , Berlin &apos;s Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a tough action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having evacu@@ ated the rooms on the ground floor , the c@@ rank s@@ mi@@ ths , and 300 polic@@ emen , the police pat@@ ro@@ wed official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three men on the ground , locked up parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown house owners , the building workers renovated the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers removed the che@@ ering of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road looks peaceful : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left @-@ hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who plays three children here , are mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who will@@ ingly desired police protection from the v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin In@@ ner in@@ ator and the police make between squ@@ at@@ ters and their neighbours , apparently does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighbourhood , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
many houses in the former G@@ DR were occupied in 1990 , including almost the entire Main Street in the vicinity of the Riga River .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under great police regulations in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ s of all over the world over the past few years . now residents of the G@@ DR are sharing their Kie@@ z with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on designed discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as body injury are based almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to make new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ement house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of in@@ security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for violence , it is weigh@@ ty : people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you help one another , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and remained .
that is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed interpretation of the district over the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road is still taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here people who are not so well are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone never li@@ stens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are anno@@ ying about colour bombs : the front @-@ projects and the left @-@ scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can complain badly there about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ gee Officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else interfer@@ es .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that deu@@ sch@@ le is now here , the ins@@ ulating wool @-@ milk @-@ sau that has above all a problem .
in this way , some - less spot@@ ting rather than target@@ ing the multitude of tasks desired - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an exhau@@ sting hom@@ etown of wool .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent job for three years ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers will soon be in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must place the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
the municipalities themselves must bear the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations .
the responsibility changes from the Council Office to Commun@@ e and Job@@ Center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his / her apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de fac@@ to , the administration doesn &apos;t find private apartments .
it doesn &apos;t work until now , so you depend on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , rural dwell@@ ings have to be re@@ conditioned , as it is said to be so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
apart from a fixed accommodation , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and remedi@@ al activities for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ one or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profits work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity doesn &apos;t just mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers such as sports , contact with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also administration and hon@@ orary officials ski@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is crucial that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
anyone who eventually creates the feeling that he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach could not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are also problems , says the customer honest , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alization after the latest occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer clearly , &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; however , a residual risk could and would not exclude them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the attack@@ ers had completely ob@@ itu@@ ated them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and hon@@ orary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in mind that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
to answer this question clearly is the policy .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also clearly shows that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew several areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men went for@@ ci@@ bly into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.@@ m .
the residents surprised the two and struck the und@@ ards in the escape .
the two men were approximately 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably m@@ asked , both of them wore blue je@@ ans and black ho@@ o@@ dies .
they fled towards the city centre .
the police set up several expedi@@ tions and a police helicopter .
the investigation was without success .
perhaps the unknown people fell in front of the apartment or when they fled .
