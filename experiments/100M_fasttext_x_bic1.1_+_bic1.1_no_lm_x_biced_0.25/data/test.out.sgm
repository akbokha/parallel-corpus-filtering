<seg id="1">Golfer Langer gets the sport pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sport pyramide" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses recalled their holidays, they hunted home in the fast gallop home to the food console.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself manage with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even fly for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports field handed over to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathic athlete lacks awards at awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th laureate of the sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "" "" "Langer says," "" "" "" "she is not only awarded for sporting successes but also for social commitment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master's winner was recorded in the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The winners include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Gienger, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumder Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion where the Lavazza Prize went.</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential evaluators are at odds with tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a basic, rather philosophical differences.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will drive back regulators massively, and he makes himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has to open disadvantaged odds and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, trump and Clinton say almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants are even announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical seapot wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, there could be still party-internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining again in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement wants to quit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand and demand the renewable energies with its investment programme: "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transporter-fish trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of USD 7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rend, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand is Trump who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics stop him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is an area manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized shelters for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="30">Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they are in Germany, is irresistible, recounts Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and abused at worst.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant to assistant physicians have called on their union to approve new combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "outsider" alliance?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday in order to give themselves their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be narrower and radiated hardly any heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan once spoke of his dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been any worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">For me, his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustained cooling by Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and accused Ankara to appeal to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The passing was even greater, since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the confidence is difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan would have benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a sort of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends he can get after he has been abducted by a failed coup d "état in almost his office last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisonous rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "a report in Vedemosti wrote it as follows:" "" "" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "to this end, the continued resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray as an analysts once described, "Alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel rejected and badly treated and now allied themselves.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave its role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they would not even have strapped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the President of Turkey deliberately failed to answer a question of their differences, while Putin decided to accentuate them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster - when NATO member Turkey threw off the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin fireplaces chief of staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed President Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was many years part of Putin's closest confidence circuit.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a statement by the Kremlin it reads that" "" "" "" "without giving reasons" "" "" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovo ordered his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been deputy director since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is said (in Russian) that he later became head of the head of the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think it is the most important job of the government to support your activity as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov, for a long time, was one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works like him for Soviet intelligence, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigns on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man, who once was touted as a potential president, at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin that are cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said it is true that I had asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated position - one could almost say - to entrust the post office for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the German Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced KGB, Ivanov was named his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that according to Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia since a third term of Turkey had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest rival to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four locks of the "deck blower" approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 slashes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses to an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the entire bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck is today in Rosyth a concrete slab for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "the first shutter is a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower roof, we had to close the existing gap on the north or north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern loading bridge 700 millimetres to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very tricky activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive as the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances, on which the team was working, were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, it's about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "SPD leader Christoph Bratmann believes:" "" "" "" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must point out 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favourable flats may, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">But the big issue in the town hall is, however, said Bratmann: "how to deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as much as 20 percent of apartments as social housing." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the problem, so Bratmann:" "" "" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants investors to make as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants tougher support for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding, as Bratmann, there is a tightening of the situation in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the scope of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of another 1300 low-priced apartments, which will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about bringing the apartments back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved on one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of the year, Fristen is running in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="28">Some 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the west city is increased drastically, it is removed from the aim of the so-called intermix.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer spending their free time with them, staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about bringing people out of the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and finally on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990ies (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, there was a decline in the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found "photographed" (via a screen shot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the turf and jumped for the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game has led to a considerable increase in increments that the "average" person sets aside every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently shared that within two days of market launch, the number of follow-up people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped by 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to take "30 minutes time" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" hit deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people looking forward.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overstated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever drives sport regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also gruelling game corruptals, which must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone apps like Fitbit could already track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with the active in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast convened on Thursday for the title of the battle and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winners and "Final Five" team combi Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Bales on the Swedish bar during the singular campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilis is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multiple battle title and overall the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought her sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bila has won the last three years of her sport, 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champions of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a last review in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athlete, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-campaign of women in gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bila won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell celebration of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi who retired in retirement.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bilo insisted that, during her long journey to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school departure in the gymnasium where Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she hasn't lost any competition competition, a winning series that will last as long as it wants.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina was easily led by two turns, the picture deceives.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish bars and ground floorings - in which Bilis holds the world title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She returned with 15,433 on the floating beam again - and with a 15,933 placed on the floor one more.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her grandchild - a pure formality - and tears streamed on fine glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision that she once described in her collective book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team captain, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their ground exercises she hurled to the audience kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Bilo is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass murder case by Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a gun fire while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police said that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery case, since the aggressor did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard stated that the shootings led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in hispanic housing areas within four months and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting which was scrapped on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-fold murder, and it was assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge shells and secured a bullet from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">Louisiana John Bel Edwards, Governor of Louisiana, shared with the local authorities that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood-water vehicles, boats and sand bags multiplied.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa had claimed tens of thousands of sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used over long parts in the south of Louisiana to Saturdays.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inch of rain could drop in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama, a flood-early warning system was used on Friday while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood a lot of houses in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream caused by downstream in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still pensed people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water of Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose greatly over night.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "he said that another step-son who lives nearby should have warned him." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and poured in," "" "" "" "said Hansford." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that emergency helpers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said the flood had spread rapidly, as there were heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer in the vicinity of Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday from 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the rain has been considerably sown by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that severe rainfalls and street flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school trips in five school districts.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a co-ordinate in Tangipahoa 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both now flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed by floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the towns of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as soon as the water starts to go back, they will return to their homes," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="36">According to his data, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded, but on Friday no reported.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many young girls of other skin colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic traveller and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see sports classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all beating the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic Games will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily used in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents, arising for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these clubs lie in prosperous suburbs which can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the communities of aun countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-reach training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trains national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high quality gymnastics to the youth, who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to interest in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by Holen des olympic team golds and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistants want to organise more strikes after they have rejected Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 resident doctors who voted on a vote rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt's plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty forcibly and said that the NHS would be in a "Niemandsland" and would be harmful to employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve the maintenance of the working hours.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistenzologists said last night in a message with "Assistenzologists still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will incite the current Occupational Crisis and it will be used to treat all the doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time is running out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to solve the disputes through talks have appealed to the government for reluctance to participate and sometimes on ear-numbing silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had only done last month that his door would always open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now to raise the condition and address the concerns of assistants." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do this, the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further combat measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved in granting coverage to doctors on the strip-chain cover.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54,000 assistants who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Director of the NHS employees, urged the assistants to end the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "work fighting measures do not achieve anything that is little, but already strain relief teams and service providers and prepare the patients, carers and their families only worries, need and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant physicians and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional apprenticeship, training teachers, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA agreements in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE regulation authority has recommended a four-year intake in order to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems further.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the artery walls which form coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, a blood clots can cause blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the flow of blood and clog the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The inaugural concept of NICE, published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">By provisional recommendations from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness will bloom electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office for corruption last year due to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness holds that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is unknowingly ignored as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally attaches the police, observers and councils to ignore evidence of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Communal Government, who is now a corruptionist politician, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lockers outside of electoral cabins to protect registered voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have a passport to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">Currently, a voter has to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests not to apply remote ink on a person's finger if they release their elective voice to prevent anyone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or workgroups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that is associated with it," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the current mayor of Lutsk was to be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynically" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Rahman said" "" "" "" "his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation where one person chooses someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud in the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He spoke in particular alarming to the fraudulent letter-election - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, illustrated, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leadership of ID cards to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as proof it was established that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladesian background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such a behaviour based on" politically correct "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists work on letter-selection documents to stop "harvesting."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration reviews to prevent the voting directory being used for immigration and social security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone chooses two times.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A 3 year limitation on applications to an automatic letter-selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban on political activists to process full postal elections and envelopes of letterheads.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have authority to set up barriers to set up electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law which facilitated an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act.</seg>
<seg id="31">No photographies in elective stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the staff generally assert that voters alone enter the electoral cab.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Constitutional Court issued Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unfit," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "he also criticises the ineffective" "" "" "" "Abhakcontrols" "" "" "" "of the town councils electives." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said, "The Judgement Tower in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robbers.</seg>
<seg id="5">When one approaches you from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and go out of the Line of Fire, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and shoulder, before you hit the face with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with his knee in the body and twist, while the Attacker is bent before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while it directs the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the Attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious examination of his immune system and throws - by making some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk lowered his course on a euro note, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a washing toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before removing each object he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he will get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick the sink of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria are located.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left him to lick, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating odd and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public money to train stations to flush toilets of toilets, the task assigned to its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its finishing line showed a luminometric count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminous number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminous number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one out of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "that comes close to the worst that I have smoked in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying" "" "" "" "Let's call Ian." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in colorectal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the movie, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things with which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others, where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey carried out by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delay with a damage of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were violently removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found ownership in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls made gaping holes, wooden boards were torn, garbage was spread on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who is working for the Home Office at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>

<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball slats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, disputes and floods.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have agreed to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years.</seg>

<seg id="17">At the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target checks submitted by the IOC before the Rio Olympics, it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">Before the summer games in Brazil, the World Anti-Doping Agency exerted a great deal of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the Shakespeare-year, the Salzburg Festival hosts the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.</seg>

<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, "Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin-American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She reminds of melancholy about her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First of all because it's musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">She is wise, of course naïve, and very passionately.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very similar to me, my Italian character which I have as a Roman," "" "" "" "laughs Bartoli." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="20">It is such an honor for us to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is seen in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a joyous approach to life, which is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the West Side Story: "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals don't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country's election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For stupid as far it is not: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who want to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidays in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are on the way, are not locals, so do not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during holidays there are helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and end up voices just laboriously.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again to pass an election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase when you can tell it at all has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU Coalition, must be afraid of his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly lagging behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how much Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of a coalition shock.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the land, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the debt of blossoming the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "their refugee policy," "" "" "" "We create this" "" "" "" "have speeded up the rise of the right-wing populists, which is probably going to cost him the beautiful office." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its nickname, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if at the wrong time, it is the right place to campaign.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel two times to make a major mistake. Merkel's German election circuit is in the Northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "" "" "complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a pity not to listen to anybody from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Nordost-CDU dispenses with the usual campaign conditions at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "this," "" "" "" "says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Union has also noted that in the country it is essential that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You are going on like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the widths of the country there is hardly any present.</seg>
<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU election champion Kokert on his co-workers is also self-revealing: "they must go where it does, namely where people are: village festivals, golden marriages, every birthday celebration has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is a lot of stake in the game, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just just ahead of the AfD (19)." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="34">Apart from that, green electoral campaigners embark on a search for local voters among the tourists.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27-Renovation: Gaststätten suffering from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end at 8 p.m., there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything pretty crisp," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jetty gas station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be relocated to the south at the start of the week until the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The mutual agreement of those responsible for the construction works will also be praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of vocational training.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has been migrated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergasse in Ofterdingen has been revoked, and thus also the connection to Rottenburg, the traffic situation within the site has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now turn from the B 27 from Ofterdingen on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomforts," says Florian King, responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstr-strasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many bleaches were looking for and rather their Navi trusted than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks frayed in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the municipality also called for the exhibition vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there were considerable transgressions," "" "" "" "says King, who obviously made himself on the spot." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been dazzling two to three times a minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way at 77 mph-kilometers in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales disbursts in them leaves anyone looking at them.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are therefore producing for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">Also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "maximum slight decline," but also admits that "the career prospects are missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The bars are most heavily shaved along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">That is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it" "" "" "" "hard." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the revenue losses he cited to" "" "" "" "far more than 50 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the road refurbishment has" "" "" "" "thrown back" "" "" "" "back for two years" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant otherwise benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other counties where so much more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been settled here since 1715, it points to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequent because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his main clientele returns to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's brutal.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these will be hard points for the SPD," "" "" "" "admits the CDU man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He still considers this to be reasonable and requires nothing to do with the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have a part in themselves: he is planning quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for incarceration of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and expose them to social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - for instance those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally delicate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some things also seem unaudible and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated ones - for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the residents of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people were deeply involved could not be clung out in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has moved enormously.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are elections.</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="36">Over the past few days, between the two parties.</seg>
<seg id="37">Only a garnerous argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the Principal chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a reversal of the dual nationality.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hasten to comment, to skip it under the pseudonym No An avenue of men's mediaeval ages with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multilingual re-emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight according to the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a humble gray suit and stuffed wildly before I stand, keep my hands and say something better as: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos slowly closes to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent salesmen were located - there is still a handful of fantastic table specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am from Sister Ray (data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already treasure," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought were too young to buy them," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retire to the stability of familiar disc grommets, from objects that evoke happy childhood memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "" "" "says WEZ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned, as I was puzzling through a pile of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of people: three middle aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead Sonic plate so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-laden, less musicastic.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say:" "" "" "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fallop, which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer- and sex@-@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz drills from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging mental traumas are hard to find when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It makes more of a window shopping than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve a lot, so collecting disks is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of disks is... "it drives off with a fallen sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record holders: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to show the jeans pants for jeans, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping themselves together for a moment about Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one most suitable for luxury items such as panels.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research has yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in record shops in Soho, have not taken into account the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They will certainly not spend their Thursday morning with the bumbling through plates shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while avoiding the starry view of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who rises over the shoulders of none of the middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to tear 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid, and that could pose a risk of fire and health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also learned that the provisional shops and restaurants often would offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary trades, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely comprehensible. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers must adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in various federal states, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are tested, which should be effectively transferred to Temposünde.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailer of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed limits, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary blitz to comply with the speed limit.</seg>
<seg id="5">But a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts for five days in continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>

<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as transit messages according to time, travel and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-year rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were defeated at the Deodoro stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-steppe, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on it in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of it, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a brite tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she was lost under Ryan's play at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and had fun bouncing GBs.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau froze in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A penultimate Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mount of men Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute jasa Veremalua went down a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "Nakarawa added a new one since the reunion and there was still a minute of playing time... in the first half." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressured by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes at half-time and closed the fijianian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed through the brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags swinging and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whiff sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB was knocking annihilating in the lawns.</seg>

<seg id="4">Even if there were only those two sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when she rode for the second Olympics agold in a second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that made such a measure.</seg>

<seg id="29">We were caught very much at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exemplary for clarity provided for 31 years</seg>
<seg id="2">The managing director of the "Veitensteingruppe," Ruppert Göller, is retiring.</seg>
<seg id="3">The association is regarded as "bayernally exemplary."</seg>
<seg id="4">A small drinking water dispenser as a model for the large water producers.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was a member of the company for 31 years, has been Managing Director for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitensteingruppe with its headquarters in Kottendorf, community Breitbrunn, supports about 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the municipalities Kirchlouder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for further cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunner mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was set as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the Zweckenstandes in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency revenues on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the renovation of the high reservoir (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no stagnation and I have always added new improvements because water is the most important food for drinking water and drinking water.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatory speech she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose-association and he lived the water-purpose-association, as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe on the water forum of the Lower Franconia district of Lower Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised the water wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water attendant and he was a faithful crap.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well-construction and restructuring of the coercive association.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult task was the pit stop at the high reservoir near Kirchlouder on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work all night at minus 17 degrees so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">The supply of Neubrunn can also be maintained only because one filled the high reservoir of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">STAHL - Lichtblick for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens which are threatened by the sector from the green electricity promotion are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the "West German Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition), when it comes to the release of renewable energies in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission initially planned to use steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros a year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with the Commissary Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for generating electricity.</seg>
<seg id="12">With this, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "with regard to our campaign" steel "" "" "" "," this is a first step. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "also in the reform of emissions legislation there are climate and employment targets," "" "" "" "said IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and substantial price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation became more acute than the world's largest producer in China cast steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accused Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">Over the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties have effect on import steel, and on the other hand the economic prospects in China have been brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would rather have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp last but not least wanted to exclude the closures of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 860,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the produced amount went back to each other for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association expects an improved order situation in the coming months thanks to an increase in orders.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, Health: singing does senior citizens good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and altogether more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good with her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to leave on the other and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive way, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the elderly, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the powder in everyday life too.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it's about getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">Elderly people often have a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of the Seniors-Organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Due to lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers suffer from long back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the feeling of self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I do long for something, I become better and waver beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing men, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior male, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the Internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who like to sing should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good for the soul and has something liberating - that is true for all ages.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bombentror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Several dead</seg>
<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the State Department, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but I could leave it again.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her journey home I planned for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether from the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also Austrian citizens are affected, be not yet unclear.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, so Schnöll.</seg>
<seg id="7">At approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Nightlife district.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning, two explosives went up again, and another person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the beach of Patong, popular among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani at the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coast.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang at the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast requested several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," "" "" "" "said army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday early in front of journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is too early to express themselves with possible motives - but probably these are the acts of Muslim rebels." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage restricted to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities had kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed about the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security related to major government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement quarters.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are repeatedely smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the latest bombing explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommending its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between the security forces and the Muslim populations, there is no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This will give the military a big influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country turns towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody disturbances, reaffirmed themselves to have led the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for many years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympic Games or world records set the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Rio de Janeiro's summer games.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia went so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was then used as an internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries well known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "Robel der Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "based on a" "" "" "" "prosperity" "" "" "", "the English boulevard" "" "" "" "The Sun" "" "" "" "made fun of him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he first struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Freestyle, did not play any role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel have also been drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">During the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani provided media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the swimming pool's appearance from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a run over 100 metres of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old got to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic meter of wastewater will be 3.44 euros for the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3.44 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (now 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (now 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a pertinent calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will be 4,37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Council of Agriculture, Kulmbach found that covers were running for these wastewater facilities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From October 1, 2016, the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.</seg>
<seg id="7">Fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As administrative manager Herbert Schmidt indicated the Board, a new calculation of the fees for sewage installations in the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period between October 2016 and September 2020, over- and overlappings from the previous calculation period are to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The gravifying fee increases were explained by Schmidt that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water drop in all three sewage installations with a very low waste of waste water, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution of distribution, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the underlying calculation period of all three systems, not least because of their age, rehabilitation and repair costs have fallen into a considerable extent.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for the Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt indicated that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the waste water system Azendorf due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pumping station Welschahl had to be overhauled for almost 20 years, and after nearly 20 years the first sewage treatment plant had to be removed, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "Schmidt:" "" "" "" "these extraordinary expenses came from the ongoing support and maintenance costs that should be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "stone houses made it clear that at the low waste of wastewater in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance" "" "" "" "were" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian cartoon criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say it is nonsensical to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already adjoining to the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that might be of a Roy Lichtenstein paintings.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-blooded, self-locking tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missiles reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested to some users a filter that gave them mud eyes, false teeth and angry cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature from Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if this repeated controversy had pointed to a greater problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature from Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely spread about the photos that the filter "hurting and mildly said was unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not unsecured, but that the yellow face has been pulled down into the downward extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company to cross this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account while others insisted on doing the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the large part of white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either she doesn't have any representation of people with other skin colours in her workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to tell."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his collaborators, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a person responsible to focus on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "Zhu said she will close her Snapchat account and added," "" "" "" "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it's not O.K." "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence intelligence, establishes congressional committee</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on site allowed, an inquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Army Committees, Secret Service Committees and the Army Committees, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Key service analysts who reported how superiors altered their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence gathering information typically enjoyed by high-level CentCom commanders marked a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives, noted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts were" "" "" "" "stated the report." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mosssuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "" "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015, the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed information while the investigations are continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway due to the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom has created an excessive process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "" "" "said the highest-level democrat in the committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff's House of Representatives in a statement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process," "" "" "" "Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "" "" "" "" damaged morality among analysts and "" "" "" "" gave too little room for different opinions "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention at CentCom analysts in terms of a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congresses were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon Inspector, which was taken up following complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of Congress while the investigators of the general inspector are still in progress.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "but he also stated that" "" "" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations lead to repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of the past year have raised the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminiscent of tens of thousands more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and did little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker determined that against the statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislative for his excessive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am not part of the people who keep their gates in memory." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are alike in their group with the Britons in the first place, which will remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will each receive the first and second place each.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take the strong Dutch girl a little longer from the path that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, Americans have provoked a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 squares.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey club in his hands for the first time at three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things better.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we didn't have the working-house in London, which we now have." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull out the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorrows in the first half of the game with a setback from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a victory, but the team proved to be surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who until now had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympics, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inescapable, a swift relay race between competition and quest.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is passed by the wristbands to the turner to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bales, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a flock of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to the Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic Trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame never lights up every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I can modestly make arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many of whom I had asked, didn't know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain exterior charme, partly because it is suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school as those for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonical cittern of his never-ending bounce - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "the word" "" "" "" "trampoline" "" "" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" springboard. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "they are rated according to the official Olympic program according to the specification, difficulty and" "" "" "" "flight time" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They chase not only the finish line or the output wall, but also another highlight in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympic ord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir one viewer to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued myself while watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an atmosphere of breathing.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline ring is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Even here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final hours will take place on Friday afternoon in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end-hours as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anthropoids and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts had recently hit according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more regions.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was merciless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen were shot and killed on an unarmed protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests which are probably from the last or early this year show how security officers hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a detailed investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, in particular in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a substantial pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continued to lead the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options apart from protesting, it breaks out," "" "" "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widespread choice last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time tensions continue along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less enforced in recent years, explode the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode under the surface after years of worsening.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially with protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are no natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who are mainly Christian high-states from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "" "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in the year 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special mandates to process opponents and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unscathed reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">In contrast to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval was 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which according to the data of analysts seemed to be misled by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of disturbances went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal demise of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharic city, headed by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by fearing that his multiple re-assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings out his co-workers who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of declaring statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump resided in terms of the allegation on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Trump while he tried to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling fractions on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump once again tried to return to this issue.</seg>
<seg id="12">Speaking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Naturally, I mean the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then back on demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive and then, if necessary," clarify "as the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who watches the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his sayings vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive tone as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading edge in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once displaced by the market, Café entered Greenpoint</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a bigamy coffee shop in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of his Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Soap Cherie shop, which made Verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people screwed it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluding and verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, it is also new finding.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old cafe, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish like capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Williamsburg," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and regularly visited the club.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take her way.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I realized it was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new additive.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I arrived quarter after seven, every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," he said.</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays Rosenthal always gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no resentment in the fact that the soap business took the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of coffee.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think we'll go to her offer," "" "" "" "said Rodriguez." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he is going to exhibit it soon, so that his new neighbors will feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has further advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee.</seg>
<seg id="42">There is a chance that the café expands onto a neighbouring building.</seg>
<seg id="43">For many customers a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites.</seg>
<seg id="44">Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.</seg>
<seg id="45">When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I had to smell it," he said.</seg>

<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serene luxury.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">Born in 1624, it floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in one hour it comes in average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it depends, the five-meter-long animal will speed up to a full 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">But this lifestyle shaped by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Greenland shark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments on this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolutionary biologist predicted that Greenland will grow stone.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">She measured six animals with a transmitter prior to Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the sharks make this shark: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt asleep animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadavers, which torso from higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sharks, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s, when a nuclear weapons investigation carried out large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lenticular core, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens core, resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimetre-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark might be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks with the multiplication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on sparks.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses warmth.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as early as possible," "" "" "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="12">Trumpet critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already abandoned that his refusal issues questions regarding assets, his donations for charitable organisations, his business and various other compounds, in particular with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already overthrown the issue and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high-ranking Republican Trump asked to publish his tax return.</seg>

<seg id="23">The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx. 40.5%.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were dealt with together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all the ministries in two years, the Council of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage objectives were examined and the bishop's city of Freiburg was finally decided, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered to the portal of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 And Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruene, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the saints, arose.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, Pastor Storost sent pilgrims to St. Anna in a small ceremony, blessed pilgrimages and shared the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where there was also a Muenster of Our Lady's wife and so the Pilgrimage was kicked off from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening with a brief impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minisers on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedely made Rast to sing together a song of specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish offices of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller took care of a tasty and fortifying dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after that, the trip to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting route, had to descend approximately 500 metres altitude at first, and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a shared barbecue at the bathing pond in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, it went on the closing stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the Minis met at Freiburg's Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the portal of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert, who arrived at the evening Mass in Münster, was welcomed by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day there was time for the Breisgaumetropolis.</seg>

<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner stopped it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus raises the supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy specified for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the melt consumes around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks losing.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-term speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting mill with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by the melt" "" "" "", "said the company." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions" that should come into force from November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the contracts have a period of 12 months, so they will end in 2017." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "therefore AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "" "" "" "said the electricity supplier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on AGL revenues from GJ 18 is currently limited by forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL stated that the value of the contracts had already been depreciated in the amount of $187 million in anticipation of termination.</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" does not impair.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year even if there is still a statement to why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>

<seg id="6">This is the stereotyped act of almost every birthday septic of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoonist on a slot at 8 am), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.</seg>

<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just scarcely ahead of the CDU, which could again rise to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contested between the left and the AfD.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: the Nokia Communicator has been on the market 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors are dominating the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was eight megabytes initially, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Nokia 9000 communicator came to stores exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, into shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, lovers can buy the equipment still on the internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the InterNet Valley.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hanover as an "office in the western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">Indeed, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible by HTML browsers, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns mobile business sector experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually sold and handled by Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market today is dominated by providers who came all much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Ever and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion devices, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">A whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="31">The decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, then Apple CEO Steve Jobs at the Mac-World announced the introduction of the iPhone.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an internet communicator, everything is easy to use via touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphal march began, even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry who dominated the market had a look at.</seg>
<seg id="35">She finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Sagen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average every German today looks back 88 times a day on his mobile phone.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">For me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will already create 10,000 new jobs alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.</seg>
<seg id="7">As they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of Heathrow is too great.</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every asked question.</seg>
<seg id="11">Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in weather-like growth and bequeathed a legacy of skills and employment to both the airport and the whole of the UK.</seg>
<seg id="13">We have a great team in Heathrow, which implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented catwalks of the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-forth struggle between the flagging open source community and the conversions has been underway since the invention of scoreboard readers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>

<seg id="15">Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killings after having passed and killed a man who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Payerne.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street, took the court.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have referred to similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still rotated slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the sun for almost two months," "" "" "" "said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This heats the surface and produces rainfall that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface of a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously thought by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although supposedly habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Pleiades</seg>
<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomers understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates and in what context the rotational periods are associated with planetary emergence.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancers, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is located 445 light years distant from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates these ripening stars repel large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winches travel through the stars of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star ages, its rotational rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn slower than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the Pleiadian Ballet we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, while faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the constellation of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the Star Halls of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," "" "" "" "said Rebull." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">There is a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how, When and Why stars slow down their rotation rates and so to speak their "dancing shoes" hang up.</seg>
<seg id="18">Rebull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Pleiades rotational rates, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.</seg>

<seg id="1">A controversial baseball star kicks off</seg>
<seg id="2">The tears ran faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in the best days from Base to Base.</seg>
<seg id="3">After his emotional withdrawal notice, the 41-year-old pro will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I love this game and this team."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time All-Star Game Duelist of the Major League Baseball (MLB).</seg>
<seg id="6">Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.</seg>
<seg id="7">His signature under a ten-year contract has given him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and a youth coach - with full salary.</seg>
<seg id="9">As a player Rodriguez paid for a long time with performance.</seg>
<seg id="10">With 696 Homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 counts for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 he has been able to earn some milestones.</seg>
<seg id="11">With Hall of Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two baseball players in the most important statistics show similar values.</seg>
<seg id="12">But the 41-year-old should not be included in the baseball hall.</seg>
<seg id="13">For so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was in the field, so controversial is its occurrence outside the square.</seg>
<seg id="14">Already in 2009, the superstar admitted to "ESPN," to have taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.</seg>
<seg id="15">In August 2013, he was closed for 211 games due to involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.</seg>
<seg id="16">Rodriguez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received high-performance funds through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.</seg>
<seg id="17">After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 meetings.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the league could even have done a favor for 2014, because I played for 20 years without a break," "" "" "" "said Rodriguez back then." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Even his farewell days do not run noiselessly.</seg>
<seg id="20">While many baseball legends have once again received the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.</seg>
<seg id="21">"my job does not include a farewell tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">"my job involves trying to win any game," said Yankees coach Joe Girardi.</seg>
<seg id="23">After all, Rodriguez, who had been married to the actress Cameron Diaz and had the relations with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy-testimonies by the fans of Yankee-Erzrivalen's Boston Red Sox.</seg>
<seg id="24">"we want a-Rod," the supporters sang at the 4: 9 defeat against the Rodriguez-Team.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping sample, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland can't start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping attacks.</seg>
<seg id="4">A skilled athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000 meters obstacle course in Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critically-dusty athletics competitions this news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was already proven last Sunday, which is used as a masked drug for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Court of Sports confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only 0,09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the courses over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) filed an application for the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also at the night of Rio the news spread over the positive trial at Danekowa, the 33-year-old went to the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "" "" "it was an incredible shock," "" "" "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">According to the report, the blood doping agent EPO should act in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the time being, thanks to BNT, the B sample should also be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov contacted the athlete immediately with criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "" "" "" "" Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation cannot participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski," known as the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon for three days.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both of them deny the consumption, but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, especially the case of Dankowa is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF had prohibited the entire Russian squad until an exception because of systematic doping, as well as the Läufernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in the swimming-sport, the earlier offences in China had caused violent confrontations also between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harass.</seg>

<seg id="1">Media lau: so perfide-presses hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware gun specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were once the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solvent demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be extored falls considerably higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are currently watching a scary fast evolution of the malware," "" "" "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski talking to the" world. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most malware programs were designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the goal, but the change to corporate attacks happened quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmavers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the final key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - usually in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without the production shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of affected German companies reported sales losses through ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business operation, in which case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only support the problem," "" "" "" "explains Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for managers it is difficult to reject the call of the perpetrators in the face of stagnation in operation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure Security Studies analysed the user's space and contact with the blackmaids and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are in fact trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, create freely accessible support sites, or decrypt example files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software package to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "" "" "says Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the underground, buy the set of a criminal and ask another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per certified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "usually criminals employ spammers with dissemination," "" "" "" "explains Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel Ransomware using file back-ups and scanning software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if data encryption is no longer a sufficient threat to successful edification, the perpetrators are now threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this way, the potential for damage depending on the type of data is still much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could take entirely new targets on the internet of things in the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the culprits then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V acts rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear, there is no place in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a trunk of 453 l available, but there is the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like kittles and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment is well loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do some quieter work.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the tested" "" "" "" "Executive" "" "" "" "version, the equipment leaves nothing to be desired." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City-emergency braking system (working at speeds 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote lighting assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent Temporegler responds to the recognition of traffic signs and throttles the speed as required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI ports lie under the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">The weather has made the shooting star Guckern in the south-west of Germany on Friday a line by the bill - but there is still hope.</seg>
<seg id="3">The night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectacle, the chairman of the observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, said on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="4">Our hope is on the night to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="5">The weather should be good, then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="6">The star-scales are Persian, which with 216,000 kilometers per hour belong to the quickest shooting stars.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which goes up in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, morning is already far from the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleeping problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Schlaeforcism and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands, however, is the Insomnia, that is, an in- and through-sleep-disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the Executive Board of the German Association of Internal Medicine with Practice in the Lower Saxony Varel, has just experienced the diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also pharmaceuticals.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently sleeping disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is common especially in case of depression," "" "" "" "says Weeß." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, woke up every two to three hours and may possibly start thinking about everyday problems and worries.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances go to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is affected by the day, consult your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any lowered sleep medicine in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why one should first contact the GP in case of sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors recommend snoring, for example, with snoring with breathing exercises, in case of illness of the day, in case of sleepwalkers, or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fibonnet explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "please do not make a midday sleep," "" "" "" "says Fietze." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one wears a nose eyewear, a chest strap and a probe at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">A camera also records the sleeping place on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few screws which can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the other hand, it counts: regular sleep and rest periods, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, avoid drinking alcohol and don't look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is completely and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has expressed himself on Facebook for disappointing the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of linden trees, in between still another cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain looks not like this, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes some playgrounds, a freshly painted nursery and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "someone" "" "" "" "ugly!" "" "" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl that will soon be demolished, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Articles about this "trendy city district," as advertised as the appropriate real estate company Friedrichshain, are preferred by burning cars in the last few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, Berlin's Innensenator Henkel has repeatedly expressed itself for a tough action by the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having evacuated the rooms on the ground floor, the crank smiths, and 300 policemen, the police patrowed official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three men on the ground, locked up parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown house owners, the building workers renovated the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers removed the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road looks peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left-hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, are mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who willingly desired police protection from the vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin Inner inator and the police make between squatters and their neighbours, apparently does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighbourhood, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many houses in the former GDR were occupied in 1990, including almost the entire Main Street in the vicinity of the Riga River.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under great police regulations in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and polls of all over the world over the past few years. now residents of the GDR are sharing their Kiez with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on designed discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "" "" "left-autonomous violence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as body injury are based almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offences make property damage, which tend to make new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenement house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as for violence, it is weighty: people in the 94 are their neighbours who are certainly not." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available directly in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you help one another, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately moved into the Rigaer Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed interpretation of the district over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer the road is still taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former mosquitoes that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - here people who are not so well are living here," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can't approve violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoying about colour bombs: the front-projects and the left-scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain badly there about noise.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July, Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else interferes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that deuschle is now here, the insulating wool-milk-sau that has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less spotting rather than targeting the multitude of tasks desired - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an exhausting hometown of wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent job for three years masturbation.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time now to find apartments for connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must place the refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">The municipalities themselves must bear the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Council Office to Commune and JobCenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his / her apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration doesn't find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It doesn't work until now, so you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, rural dwellings have to be reconditioned, as it is said to be so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">Apart from a fixed accommodation, there are internships, training centres, training places, one-euro jobs and remedial activities for refugees and migrants who have to be undone or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profits work - and that motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contact with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also administration and honorary officials skip.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is crucial that the refugees feel they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who eventually creates the feeling that he could not help anyone in Urbach could not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problems, says the customer honest, "people with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization after the latest occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer clearly, "what some may call naive." however, a residual risk could and would not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the attackers had completely obituated them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "says Regine Kunde." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in mind that a new push for refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," "" "" "" "says Annika Deuschle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also clearly shows that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
