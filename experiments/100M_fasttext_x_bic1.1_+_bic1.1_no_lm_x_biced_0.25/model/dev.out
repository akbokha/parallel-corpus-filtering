Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing sett@@ ling and thro@@ ws Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will during the peace process .
the deal struck by the Iranian nuclear program has deteri@@ or@@ ated the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans at the invitation of the Republi@@ can , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election forth@@ coming election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor , his girl@@ friend shot dead
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told us with a somewhat angry voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officers would have to come to his house .
it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ s and a hand@@ written note that was sc@@ oring on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sig@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that University employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the dis@@ astro@@ us emergency call some@@ time later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him .
one day after shooting at the university , the students and lectur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were happy with his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ s died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
he had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the doc@@ torate , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an adjustment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer anymore .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car still ran in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 he began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long @-@ standing girl@@ friends described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
he was the women &apos;s flock then .
all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ s were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house that borders a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ s , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
he met Pr@@ enti@@ s when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair for three years ago .
later they played together the one or other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ s Night in the night of September 5th for the last time when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica pi@@ el before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and chat@@ ted with each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his br@@ otherhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lectur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot down Schmidt and that lamb was in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ s , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
toys R Us say that it won &apos;t be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business draws closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equi@@ p shops with employees selling , sending , and delivering products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simul@@ ated ya@@ wning and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says its response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader reiter@@ ates all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Meeting of Ministers to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ itting in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation insol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ban demanded the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria in order to cope with Iran &apos;s nuclear deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks near surveys , it didn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody says that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was given leadership to the rising Her@@ man Cain , from which none of them also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing t@@ umps through stamina and start to flow their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some up @-@ to @-@ date surveys indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Any@@ a@@ thei@@ st values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa stated last week that 60 percent of rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers were happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , they would either be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 per cent of rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans do not see tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independent people say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , so ABC / Post .
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
when they set up their hon@@ orary hat@@ s , rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers hold tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers see tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to tr@@ umps , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he made 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ uns and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have issued their votes .
of course , much can happen to change this , and no one can really say never to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , tr@@ umps is the strongest competition in the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in the issue of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign , two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rape , &quot; was immigration and fishing point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is critical of His@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated about the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg , the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea watt .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ing house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which particular layers a square meter is most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student booking in Munich are not really little .
unlike Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the costs comes from the price of pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noted .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
champ@@ ions League : Bayern Dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold tor@@ ches in Pira@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller blessed the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pira@@ eus - then it was running .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pira@@ eus .
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Göt@@ z Hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series will be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League on the Champions League for the Bayern leadership of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as a flan@@ k @-@ thought shot of the World Champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m had promised hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium - and the Munich spoke word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without sh@@ ading .
Pi@@ re@@ aus has won his youngest six home games in the royal class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 we also stum@@ bled at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bayern , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went courage@@ ously , but in their offensive efforts often too imagin@@ atively to work .
the attacks were often initiated by bac@@ kl@@ ash on the left side Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7. minute the World Champion gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first of all , as the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ted with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to set needle lace .
on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer was a decree .
for instance , when he took a shot of ide@@ ye about the latte ( 5 : 6 ) .
before New , Guardi@@ ola had a four @-@ chain @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ res , sat outside at first .
the World Cup hero had only given the green light after the final training , &quot; said Sport@@ u@@ ke Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to do something else , this is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it clear for 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller was still on top of it .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly displac@@ ed Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator blo@@ c obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pira@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smoking was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are cavi@@ ties and inflammation of the gum , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to more frequent gum inflammation in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear how much smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smoking , Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham .
people must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , said head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and leads to good dental health as well as high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by pl@@ ung@@ essness , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study inhi@@ bits the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists stum@@ ble on lef@@ to@@ vers from the late antique c@@ et@@ u@@ fer on the Rhine river
for the repeated time at the right bank of the Rhine , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine .
near the building site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called land monuments .
at all construction projects in the Cologne district of Cologne , the museum has always been added to the Department of Archae@@ ological Floor Ex@@ pos@@ ure .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now five .
the text document was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , Trier explained .
beside the remn@@ ants of the fortress and the church of the church there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private screening facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that corresponds to much more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström at the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP will develop the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are in concrete terms that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA and from third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judg@@ ments .
until now , the proceedings took place on the arbit@@ rators , a possibility of ob@@ jection to their judg@@ ments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work according to their own data on an international investment court .
there could then also be clari@@ fied disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , above all , are considered one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism to negotiate damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws or to impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations such as Camp@@ act accepted the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account significant points on reform , the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restri@@ cting the action of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could thus be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the Free Trade Agreement T@@ TIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded , it remained un@@ clear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected at the premiere of the Prime Minister with excitement
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to be his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire and to set up with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to set up the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guidance , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C @-@ Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them at a commemor@@ ative celebration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , prov@@ okes criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands in the center of several title pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; Hel@@ dent@@ um of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liament@@ ary party originally supported him as a guide .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also stack@@ ed within Labour &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour to set up changes in order to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ work and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26.@@ 000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory Chef , over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament last decade .
the Labour Party , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Cro@@ wd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the question of the Prime Minister is con@@ front , and that he has been under@@ going both &quot; impact strength &quot; and the stri@@ pping with resistance , and instead has decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; Jud@@ y @-@ Theater , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question .
since it was broadcast on television first in 1990 , the cargo was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose rapidly after data that showed an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s target .
between May and July , the result without any bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and raised estim@@ ations at the time of an increase in interest .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index included an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont was 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares increased by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares in the packaging and paper group Mond@@ i were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , and with a drop by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sport@@ swear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CEO of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese on a potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
it goes both - and in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss@@ propriet@@ or Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat have put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster on a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally seen on television .
since then there is a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has now become the Leban@@ ese patent office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding also goes well with his customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Con@@ soli@@ dation Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ dies
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA stores in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump aboard , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day .
it is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia are almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take around five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million revenue per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and food business grew by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trading , which has around 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , which reflects the operating loss of debt on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler does however , and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to equal selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to deliver I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores with fast growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurb@@ ishment programs are to be set up and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly referred to as &quot; special Ks , &quot; got into the spot@@ light by the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison excl@@ aimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had Kyr@@ gios beat , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ote a tennis bat , after a cra@@ mp@@ f en@@ du@@ red a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I &apos;m pretty rich is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was a bit dra@@ gged down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat because he lost because of a cra@@ mp@@ ing in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision that Kyr@@ gios does not take into account the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has done very quickly to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made , but we try to support him , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the ra@@ mp , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stand , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and ri@@ eg@@ ged the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all firmly that tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian deployment police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some referred to protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was unacceptable that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ sized Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be that the EU states would include more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put his hopes on a bal@@ eful action from Brussels or his neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency stand that was called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to stated that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to the European Union .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany .
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us , which caused the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , which is expected for the next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on Friday .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country .
they come here by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of carrying out crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train car with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he can@@ did@@ nt for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is established which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and ties , but these projections have decreased .
your support in men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders will only be back with 5 points .
Clin@@ tons &apos;s advantage for democratic vot@@ ers under 50 years has become volati@@ le , and they and others are now at the same height .
Clinton , however , has a big advantage in older vot@@ ers .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin of the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections nation@@ wide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some privileges and further 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly , Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - just about one quarter would inspire them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and vot@@ en@@ ability are also c@@ ited .
as the vice president poses a potential for the president &apos;s office in the or@@ phan@@ age , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic vot@@ ers are asked to choose who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to candidate for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of S@@ anders increases from 20 points with bees in the race on 30 points without him in the race .
Clinton &apos;s five @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ ers .
similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers is considered unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important characteristics of vot@@ ers in the pres@@ election of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
democratic vot@@ ers in the elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
given questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic vot@@ ers of the pres@@ election are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the vot@@ ers of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting rights they do not hold for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of the vot@@ ers entitled nation@@ wide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good marks at leadership .
from the six candidates tested Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority looks rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tr@@ ump on a nation@@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the vot@@ ers are supported by the vot@@ ers in the new pol@@ l , and others lose their grip dramatically .
rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support grows 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son goes well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ uns , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and by 10 % support last month at now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - with 19 % support in the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
having a look at one of Car@@ son &apos;s last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s faith in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign show in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing lovers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings bur@@ dened
almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder deposits are filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack filled with sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members of the F@@ ossi@@ ans began to hide and set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood on the principle of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ sig@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been added with bl@@ unt power injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a indictment due to murder third grade for the first five members .
two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for the attacks and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or in@@ officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increase in interest will come , and the household shall fall into debt , and returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know how long this will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only minor instructions for the exp@@ iry .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank strongly emphas@@ ise that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was likely to be exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that funds will be cancelled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a recent study to what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is mostly in upward trend - about 14 per cent - on the way to the interest rate , fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , CEO plant @-@ strateg@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the raising cycle and the return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is remarkable that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , there was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants took the whole year to a pinn@@ acle of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all increase cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are now 74 months .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease in the cycle is carried out .
at the end of the ascent cycle , the bond issues fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ists believe that the rise in the interest rates will lead to closer together returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin near Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jones says that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit span has expanded and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed ag@@ grav@@ ated its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that wrap the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively for three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose the majority , Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savings could see profits by higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how quickly it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the station because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ itated only The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice &apos;s mission and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Euro MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ c@@ aster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seems to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously called examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director dism@@ issed the alle@@ g@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education of the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works , I really consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to do is to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show of BBC , purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in special BBC fashion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales rose in August at the slo@@ west and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the recordings in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has bra@@ ked the issues
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities .
but experts say that there are signs that online sales stag@@ nate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ nate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG selling complex to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began working with their mobile purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is reduced .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer fought for bar@@ gain , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spending was issued a little more than 1 £ online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - B@@ in Lad@@ ens &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi B@@ in Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed to Mec@@ ca &apos;s grandfather .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to make their respect , when the first of the dead entered their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the proc@@ ession went on to the holy place , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell onto the bed .
the bodies were released for funeral , when the Saudi king passed over the construction company of B@@ in Laden because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction imposed .
the bodies of 29 people killed when a crane collap@@ sed by the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi @-@ officials have already stated that the h@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man , the B@@ in Laden group , would not have been able to steal the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the B@@ in Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company is prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the overthrow of the crane that rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Great mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch that takes place later this month .
the B@@ in Laden group has no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ opped the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mek@@ kas Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project led by the B@@ in Laden group .
the B@@ in Laden family has been connected to Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dead leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials agreed that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to the members of the killed are to be paid and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over @-@ over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British employ increasingly craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen , will be opened
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q stores nation@@ wide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City CEO correspon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
for the British increasingly employ craftsmen to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ f@@ jobs in their houses , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the tree @-@ markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services to low prices is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the shop are hit by women .
at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
we must shift this more strongly towards a balance .
basically , half of our clients consist of 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also turned their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and financial position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group o@@ wed the costs for closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of office abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to Ober@@ sta@@ ats@@ an@@ walt Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ end@@ ant revealed that in 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ end@@ ants used funds of club accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
with some 400@@ ,000 euros , the damage was reported to the damage .
the sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial transactions .
this fact was the Chairman of the Opening Council , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
for the dis@@ loyalty of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence constituted that the association was not at no point in the event of an asset .
the sport@@ s@@ men had only compens@@ ated for expenses and had invested in the sports club for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Passi@@ va was bet@@ ting around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s go on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debts .
in addition to the financial - success , the reimbur@@ sement of the expenses of the expenses was retro@@ active until 1991 .
therefore I have paid a part of the repar@@ ations first years later , namely from 2003 when a plus had been on the account .
for this reason , flat and non @-@ detailed statements seemed to be explained , the former ob@@ man explained the processes .
the accounts and savings accounts administered the two def@@ end@@ ants , said the second accused .
why the pay@@ outs were not dis@@ closed in detail , the judge asked .
the association has not been interested in the detail of the financial results , it is important that only the freedom of debt has been , the answer .
in 2011 an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the club account as a result of the official investigation .
these were back@@ ups , declar@@ ing the accused .
this securities account went on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know any answer for a long time .
then he said he had believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor set up in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , justified the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent salary , he merely calculated mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not show the accused .
these were after an operation examination , in which everything was considered correctly , no longer had been kept , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the dwell@@ ings were made in cash , for that he had to drive international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to the number of personnel cuts running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs .
the actuators at the US Compu@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) are no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer .
as a result , costs in the amount of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will be dropped from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share gave up 2.3 percent .
the company that has grown with printers from California Pal@@ o Alto is now up @-@ to @-@ date : in this way , the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be recorded on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting and massive positions on change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has recently responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more shops online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans stipul@@ ate the reduction of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in comb@@ at@@ ants in Iraq would largely rep@@ udi@@ ate : 54 per cent said that 35 per cent expressed themselves .
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive .
on the other hand , 24 per cent are to intervene in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with the Syrian regime Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad reject 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day on the 6@@ 6th I@@ AA
at the centre of the fair stand up to 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electric mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the wide audience can visit the I@@ AA from Saturday .
the organizers of the V@@ DA car association expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : erup@@ tion of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ thro@@ wers against several hundred displac@@ ed refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line had been formed and a water@@ shed was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sho@@ cks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially sat down with pep@@ per@@ mint .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now declined slightly .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees caught in themselves and suffered under breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent will be held .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good performance level , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ sty outlook on global conditions .
it has warned the markets to set up an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
death cont@@ actor at the Delta State University left excuse
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; I am sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He killed someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably won &apos;t be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when the police hit the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ s , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb traveled 300 miles to the Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ s also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ s had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ s were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ s .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I called relatives at a given time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night he drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate as his life @-@ cl@@ aw on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor also said to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was sentenced to drug ownership .
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group will save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
the Group &apos;s workforce will cost around 1,000 executives worldwide .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment is an earnings contribution of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no management board for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings balance line should be developed as independently as possible .
at the board team headed by Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new position Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 staff was complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective agreement with the pilot @-@ certificate Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be res@@ um@@ ed after the court stopped on this Thursday .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frame of his right leg .
while this brought the left external def@@ ender to we@@ eping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was built into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ cture and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very hard and then fantastic , and then this happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frame , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group stage .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;

with the European Championship in France , the United Kingdom Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad at this . I &apos;m sorry .

certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s a thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost out@@ war@@ dly .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems to always have a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead presents a content of the movie release of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win a real tree , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was silent and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that would not be susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ fici@@ ally and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he wants to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , a Un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the gre@@ edy , trees fal@@ si@@ fy , Th@@ ought stri@@ cken On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , bu@@ stling nature called &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who didn &apos;t read The Lor@@ ax a child 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street Spe@@ aker said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral campaign .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but there was no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that has chosen England for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
message @-@ related message : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are oriented towards results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are their own best vot@@ ers .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not receive such good achievements , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton was nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can lift was that England first set Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist I highly appreciate .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much .
it must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to sm@@ ash Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would yield an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a devil player of cri@@ cket players .
mo@@ een may not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred races immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people possibly see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ ins that raise their hands and the coaches have chosen themselves for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience since it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previous said .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain out of the EU ) could win at Zul@@ u if the economy by 2017 becomes a flute unit
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ balanced re @-@ negoti@@ ating strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at fre@@ und said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like this if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ iss@@ ful force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will take a leg out to help the British , whose energy should be used better for it , Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even inten@@ tionally not plan useful notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re @-@ trial was a loan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the re @-@ trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , however , as they were not inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all his de@@ priv@@ ation , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this includes the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ing foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ in@@ mates who have most of our great newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that if you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;re better distributed ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch elec@@ tors in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press never moved him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to spend more time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ th year , an error at that time and today .
it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I just press it friendly - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a reform@@ ist EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wil@@ ful fav@@ ours of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs struggl@@ ed in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow workers and de@@ pu@@ ties according to all reports on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even has touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks sure .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in accordance with their Benn@@ ite Siege business , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be oblig@@ ated to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the load capacity of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month interven@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteri@@ on decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive from the tobacco company Philip Morris International , added them .
the reasons for selecting the members of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which include a sector finance in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco pipe of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is marked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to quit smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers were &quot; premature . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what proof and not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually at a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national competence .
BBC should give up East@@ ers , says former boss of Channel 4
the former President of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent that would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee within the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you want to keep the radio fee , which I don &apos;t think in medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to reach a wide range of support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ers is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to see how this is supposed to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that this would l@@ essen the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , conducted channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC give what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather publicly @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they do not meet their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion £ broadcasting , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value here .
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s right , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and maintain their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should change in &quot; inform , clear and enter@@ tain the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment when they have sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the power @-@ up of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : read researchers and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with microsc@@ opic air bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P 4 ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of its mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to worms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which needs to be sent to a optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves may happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily become suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the cheerful voice and carto@@ on pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world &apos;s largest weapon fair is a milit@@ ant par@@ ody that was produced by Am@@ ne@@ sty International to put weapons on re@@ pres@@ sive regimes on Defence and Security Equipment International Jam@@ bor@@ ee at Excel Centre in London Do@@ ck@@ lands .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible on bus stops and underground trains and that require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : from 15 to 18 September with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you can read the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank .
in September , a flock of tru@@ ste@@ ers will drive with the DL@@ R ... customers will be asked to help stop the cease @-@ fire trade show .
the 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ pack of Allen keys , from which it is claimed that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;
transportation for London finds this poster &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; not funny .
one of the par@@ ody ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to G@@ avin Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lectur@@ er at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will be critical and try to bring political works to the public outside of galleries .
many artists join forces within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters welcomes commuters in the subway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video has been viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist , who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was aston@@ ished by the silence that reigned around the advertising for the weapons fair - by a le@@ st@@ ell of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a collapse of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors feel fantastic eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ tic products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a press release , Sa@@ ab reveals an order of the US army over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the shoulder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; uniqu@@ ely shaped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unique &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; result that delivers outstanding performance effects within the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student homes
eleven years ago , I moved to a student residence as self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who have anno@@ yed me - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly ner@@ ven@@ ing up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ud@@ dle : people tell where you come from and where you have taken a sab@@ bath year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
leave people .
the rooms of people are often transformed into beverage recipes , film night venues and community meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not think about starting at university with a relationship
intro@@ vert is given a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a person is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead .
tap A@@ pro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student homes had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
as you start the Uni at the climax of Back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to introduce themselves with a plate full of browser , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked you something . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
home @-@ made goo@@ dies are a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps made of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you arrive .
steal food is a common crime in student homes .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the owner of the milk .
the chances are good that they say to themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a det@@ erg@@ ent to her milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if it makes them something , drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she pl@@ under@@ ed her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would coinci@@ de with the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , re@@ tire to them , separate themselves and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they all come up with all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his key in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ultim@@ atum and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stick is funny , but it takes only moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
replace a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys into a glass of water that you put in the freezer - but t@@ ack your pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Single Dra@@ wing , Ger@@ ing@@ earned
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the single mother and the Ger@@ ing@@ earn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build and build well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass housing in containers or gymnas@@ tics has no sustainability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because people stay in a large part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need enough living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if you bring people into blocks .
each of the six houses built just in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ der : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is worth € 184 000 , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the construction regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have dra@@ gged my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the dro@@ oping dam value special construction and the pitch regulation .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under construction , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury homes for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it is true that we had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years , but luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the Ger@@ ing@@ earn .
I &apos;ll show how to build and build well today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to Get the New iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , select &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install .
some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message that tells me that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the emergence of the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during updating , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may shut@@ down on half @-@ way and this could lead to a break@@ age of updates .

Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new place at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consult@@ ations , you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain to the inner city .
more specifically , the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive information on questions such as care insurance or health care services .
for years now , with our out@@ patient care service we have established that often used relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; although the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; the new owner explained in Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the citizen hospital as well as for the &quot; Amadeus &quot; ambul@@ ant service .
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
you can therefore use additional offers such as assault prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center sees both business leaders especially in demographic change .
because this is a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , dedic@@ ates himself to the club office at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a great contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent as possible and well in their familiar environment .
the Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ büro is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Satur@@ days from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

men tested on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them to wait for him .
at that time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men sh@@ ou@@ ted the young man and struck this with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al break and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to their home and drove there demon@@ stra@@ tively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the bat and another male person .
under the acceptance of a stroke , one checks on the face and th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
until now there is only a v@@ ague tat@@ ter description .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was cloth@@ ed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

in addition , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen retired in retirement , his successor is Karl @-@ Heinrich his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the rock formation years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently under@@ went their vocational training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was so far , I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller pleased the idea of doing his own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also looks to be his own boss soon .
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller was also raised up , his medical studies in Hannover followed by stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district in 2009 and is dedicated to Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen &apos;s DR@@ K readiness .
starting September 19th , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alis@@ es in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as house doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a consultation room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a total of 500@@ 00 euros will receive the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding programme from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the Sam@@ t@@ gemeinde ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are to continue the practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes vel@@ vet may@@ ors Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into practice in the field of field breaks , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor had found , she would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers talk , by the way , continue to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the rock walls .
with their f@@ arewell ends in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the medical professionals practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen rec@@ alls sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long period of time , a little bit of melanch@@ oly already felt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will often see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband adds la@@ ch@@ ingly : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now it could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application would also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees er@@ ect .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not look like this in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already very controlled as an external border of the Schengen Area .
as the Minister emphasized , Slovenia wants to make its limits for refugees but not abri@@ dged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out his commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government said , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday in order to avoid the registration in East Africa at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly met police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country was counting about 4,000 refugees , Minister of the Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to make people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border from Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has grown , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could actually be the predicted shift from the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly far@@ ther west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had pointed out that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees in favour of possible exceptional situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details he did not call , but pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently witnessed a good record of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed .
there would not be very high refugee figures at this time .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still no min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having given an insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ Place and PR News@@ wire .
with the collected information , insi@@ der stores should have been made on the financial markets .
thus , a total of more than 100 million dollars were taken to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present comparison shows that even those outside of our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the S@@ EC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial against 32 other accused in the event continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators should have acted out both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , sometimes fast pac@@ ed , partly cozy bum@@ ble@@ nd .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep urban rail@@ ways .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ y life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large panels each with the heading &quot; Before I die I &apos;d like to die .... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid attracted attention to her 20 @-@ year existence with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and discussions as well as the volunteer staff .
while a pass@@ ant spontane@@ ously attacks the circle and the sentence around &quot; my life be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; read &quot; with the camper by the US , &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long to suffer , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action on itself , about life , dealing with the dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband der Ö@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
however , that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables , be understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people .
an assessment that shares Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and funeral minister is one of the hon@@ orary employees of the first hour .
through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking an hon@@ orary official , she immediately reported and had been with her in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle the experiences and experiences made by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , stop it for precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and non @-@ confes@@ sional .

Fed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for vacation time .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predi@@ ctions .
anal@@ ysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view is despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher supplements for bo@@ d@@ gers of heavy and large packages , which are collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income will result in considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which was predicted by twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research anal@@ ysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked anal@@ ysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments , which brought sales in its unit Express disp@@ atch to stag@@ nation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June .
on their most expected meeting in the year Federal Reserve Strat@@ egen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade .
dro@@ pping over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ story session hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set up the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented stimul@@ us by the short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is also only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Head of Economics at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is subject to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase of interest this week .
however , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promise that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones industrial average j@@ umped at 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed Policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so she won &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would re@@ assure the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the pro@@ position expected .
although the creation of jobs slo@@ wed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation went constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world looked together at the end of the month , after China had upgraded its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value coinci@@ ded by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle the global growth .
this month the market has recovered slightly , whereas the D@@ ow is now about 10 % below the level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy did not occur over the past few weeks , &quot; Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank .
now he predi@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency agency has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 was that the F@@ ed could &quot; close their monetary expansion &quot; caused confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to monitor not only the developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that seem to be associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , applied for an increase in interest , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to reduce its conduc@@ tance by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited apparent impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lack@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives left these cuts .
the F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market collapse in 2008 , said Adam S. Poz@@ nan , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement of the Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she fears of an increase in interest , because the markets upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think they should rush ahead .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with their 74 L@@ enzen they are still instruc@@ ting them .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at Dill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .

Rio Grande &apos;s Pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society promotes food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to clarify how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sp@@ orth@@ alle
the Bern@@ ried municipal council approved the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ h@@ ello Construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent joint session the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously dis@@ closed without major discussions .
before that , the committee had decided , among other things , an application for a building legal &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid building plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we went to permit a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof over@@ stand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this means we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; it was again the incl@@ ination of the roof , which is required for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan - under ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof incl@@ ination does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is usually rather restri@@ ctive in the case of liberation .
however , during turn@@ around construction there is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gym hall construction at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
at cost around 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and width sports promotion .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the Council Office for the Ex@@ am@@ ination .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of staff draw from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the Supervisory Board , however , will decide on this decision on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , all the nearly 50 employees will continue to work at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the next internal station .
the rooms are present .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a work@@ station in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to the game , who agreed to take over the line from October 1 , and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
over the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree to both houses until then in the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ antry , which has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the district had planned this for 2018 if the currently ongoing rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the supervisory board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ rie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ es could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fishermen about the Qu@@ asi move to the le@@ ch that had been &quot; positive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and comprehen@@ sible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital of Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was constantly threatened in the past few decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .

during the last season , the Bad@@ ener referred to the B@@ HC a painful defeat and got something good there .

a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violence since Saturday .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old who was arrested in the Tuesday evening was also regarded as susp@@ icious , and the investig@@ ator was also responsible for the discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after they did not arrive at home on the eve of a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met with the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the event of respon@@ dents in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the susp@@ ects , there was finally a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , according to the authorities , the police inter@@ rog@@ ated the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse into the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented at the Haf@@ tri@@ chter on wed@@ n@@ esday , the investig@@ ators put him dead to the burden .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long ago begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with income @-@ weak citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
in this way , 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many hit the apartment market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rented apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of the past years .
Germany goes wrong with a housing deficit that becomes bigger from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama because of the Fl@@ au@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has been decl@@ ining for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; suggests a new start .
new incentives should boost the social housing construction again .
this way , the land tax will be dispens@@ ed with , and the land tax will be limited to a temporary basis for subsidi@@ zed flats .
in addition to the Alliance , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the Kf@@ W state bank is already well established in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start on Monday evening with 184 million euros had already been retri@@ eved more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project could even be sto@@ cked up .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia establish cor@@ ridor
after Hungary , practically no pass is coming , since more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia .
Zagreb announces the departure of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
however , the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if necessary we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dep@@ ortation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees emig@@ rated to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television broadcasting RTL .
on the day before , Hungary had sail@@ ed its border to refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; you can travel through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both by bus and with ta@@ xis in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter border f@@ ences .
for this reason , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ers should now quickly create a secure passage .
after Hungary , however , after the closing of the border , there are hardly any more refugees .
on Tuesday , the police counted 36@@ 6 people attacked .
shortly before closing on Monday there were still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws rein@@ force the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a criminal .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the prisoners threatened prison sentences up to five years and the dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a view to receive asylum in Hungary .
according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be dep@@ orted there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
pl@@ ywood were broken down and one of the record stores in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees .
the country also strengthened its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the further journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped on the morning by the German authorities .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ and@@ oned &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge , when ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow in Austria , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and saw the structure together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
first of all , we did not even c@@ ud@@ dle the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE to Pass@@ au on Sunday evening to try it after the short @-@ term announcement that the rail traffic was set to Germany but still to try the border .
the regional train was put off at the Inn at W@@ ern@@ stein at the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge @-@ fest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , on Sundays a two @-@ wheel@@ er racing - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án sends further tens of thousands to us is a logical result of an apparent policy :
instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has officially opened the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Soci@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bodies of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blessed land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to produce decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers in the face of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be one even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 3@@ 5,000 winter @-@ resistant quart@@ ets
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has to do all hands with refugee support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight .
the government used the former powerful Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the birth@@ place of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , would be without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 should provide the federal states , 15,000 the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a drum without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the main people .
these would have assured him , even for the coming refugees to create qu@@ arti@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations the asylum coordin@@ ator sets out in the ORF promotion &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodations .
in addition , you are hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors need to hold a certain amount of the towel bracket or size of the superi@@ ority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards must be considered for a temporary period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the interior ministry , he was more successful in terms of accommodation , he founded Konrad with his experience .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom you can &apos;t say without further my face .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to cost how they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , his own quest was not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with hom@@ olog@@ ation .
Linz calls for a better distribution
not only an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , since the victims are currently under control without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
criticism of the city head on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seals : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has ac@@ counted for further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders are not sealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees in Germany will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guards would , however , be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is covered by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
in fact , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to grow a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad : after all , she has received an increase in the form of another business calendar .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business , in which they sold bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been re@@ mod@@ elled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long over@@ laid if I want to open up a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given Br@@ eit from her mother into the cra@@ dle .
I am most suitable when something is developing and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can also not be answered with last safety .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag is upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ ders .
this property also combines some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ ense .
whether he expresses himself in a foreign language , journalist , or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office whir@@ led the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the Wein@@ straße .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt fashion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , which besides Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for hum@@ ility , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to say that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , listened to &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ makers &quot; - to high @-@ German : the credi@@ tors , she says .
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the US .
corn@@ erst@@ one of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Folk Dog@@ s , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken to Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to fri@@ ghten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dist@@ ancing the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ anding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never had arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump , has seen 12 000 cinema singers , even in the USA also awak@@ ens the interest .

Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts at the Today reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was em@@ itted by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today a slight increase compared to ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 a.m. to 5 : 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 a.m. to 6 : 00 pm ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Seat average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening by The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Seat will eventually prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars that couldn &apos;t manage the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret un@@ veiled ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparent who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , finally lan@@ det at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before going out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given a hint to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers become per@@ ish@@ able who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly called - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and I noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty compatible , and I &apos;ve thought it throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ conditional on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose who wood should choose if not she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a cl@@ ad as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his sleep@@ y catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ rolled at a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights of gay rights

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free vot@@ ers demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high amount of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn sound in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt in front of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there is no correspon@@ d@@ ingly new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get promises in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free vot@@ ers t@@ opped up to Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
quite different main themes were actually planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the Free elec@@ torate @-@ meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will over@@ lap the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible .
for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also requested more personnel for the administrative dishes that are responsible for asylum systems : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are br@@ anding nation@@ ally uniform standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : educational policy .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police fired a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Apostle officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of you threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they hit the rubber floor .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber stor@@ eys used , from which it is known to be able to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ amm@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed within the proposed new constitution , would decrease their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , among them 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed by centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legislature has voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and living is planned - but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the site for a mix of trade , commerce and living .
waiting for appropriate offers is called by the city .
which investor question is coming , is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which lies on the Ring Road / corner Great Street , already purchased a few months ago and leaving the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor first presented plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their vac@@ an@@ cies
for months behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , sal@@ ted , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ der Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which repro@@ ached the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered any questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the debate about ten to twelve million euros has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ ds that came into the meeting called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ landlord and member of the board of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears as many other project critics that the traffic through the intended size of the system would increase sharply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus inv@@ itations must come so that this pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the good one h@@ ect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the construction plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to aid the thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google associate who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old about their personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , who has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many flee from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
reporting of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ umb
for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I under those under@@ went this operation sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I stayed with those who did not receive surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded the diabetes condition and partially dissolved in 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved by only one percent and in some cases with only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , such as Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastro@@ ec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who undergo a obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 that are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting for too long to take people seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly established their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently increasingly important in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
as well as recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis was in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called on to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under certain circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees , it is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how killing will be reduced in their countries .
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the issue of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US dra@@ gged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that swal@@ low alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , so Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reported the poison control centres , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately drink while some do to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant can only drink because of a cheap experience .
teenagers suppos@@ edly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange showers which are very attractive for children .
suspended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially in small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sprit@@ zer from after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered to an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ ed her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs Mutter , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three pupils of the fourth class in the state of New York were planning to poison their &quot; gem@@ ental &quot; teacher by laying out anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; it reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ wä@@ tz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic needs to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following resig@@ nation from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now stood at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like this - but we need to go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
getting together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious at January @-@ Transfers
despite his comments only a few weeks ago that pointed out that he ha@@ sten@@ ed several January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious at the signing of new in@@ accessible and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x ca@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in summer have this season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

the Hearts had 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later repe@@ aled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen desper@@ ately had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in Po@@ kal@@ play or Li@@ gen that won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4.000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period by 10,000 rose to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was 5.5 percent higher than the figures of the Bureau for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) .
in the meantime employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number of the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundations for stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day drew near@@ er , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and as often more applications are available as places available , a ma@@ xi lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will watch it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ ps close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she cleared her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It would have been better to form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve done .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of deed .
but I think there is a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man according to mo@@ ist police chase out to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he over@@ spoke the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang up the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale have been sum@@ mon@@ ed to a home @-@ peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he focused on ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cobal@@ t test sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ g@@ ations and did not want it to look like a high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk raised head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if you start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before , Moo@@ dy had put the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integr@@ ity Department had tried to spy on his st@@ ables .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their nos@@ es because they have failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should I think that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave co@@ war@@ dly and is perhaps responsible for people outside of trainers for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and fail me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , the train@@ ers have built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to &quot; throwing his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Caviar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has wron@@ g@@ ly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy re@@ jects ri@@ vals due to claims on ring@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ises the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators allowed the Storm players &quot; ring struggles &quot; with his team during the high season finale in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly conce@@ aled note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only focused on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team was confident that she was worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; I &apos;ve never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring struggles when she said to us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything at our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus and this has provided us the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . so he &apos;s probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny , as this always appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you &apos;d like to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like these .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and do not have any points of tension ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday night in the final final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug discovery
a man who might have threatened a life @-@ long sentence because of his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the J@@ ach@@ th@@ afen during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long sentence for attempting to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of danger at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the failed declar@@ ations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ ides in the Australian and his Serbian passport , reported daily by the police and stops at an output barrier between 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile to send pictures
a P@@ äd@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl when this was asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately im@@ pover@@ ished her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analysed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for un@@ decent images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials that he had done it , since it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ction that he is ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people .
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but he said that it was happening because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he did it to l@@ ure them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Schle@@ user devi@@ ates on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up in the German @-@ Austrian border away from the major control points .
many tu@@ gs were afraid of discovery and arrest of people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ubs to the German side .
there they are received by Bundes@@ polic@@ emen and for@@ warded to the registration .
on the Munich Hauptbahnhof ( Hauptbahnhof ) the Federal Police Department met more refugees in comparison with the week of the week on Wednesday .
only until 8 pm , some 700 people arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of inspec@@ tions at the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : drop@@ let of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; is expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm rain in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a deep @-@ pressure area over Western Europe , warm ocean air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the runner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who was drawn over the Atlantic in the last days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , it is still in the Black Forest , in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the soil @-@ seek@@ er with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 hours per hour .
on Friday you can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the cars at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , above all , there is a move to the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new regi@@ strations fell to this segment alone in August alone .
this is reflected in the I@@ AA ( public stage 17 @-@ 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at the dealers in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel is launching an entry below the biggest VW Golf competi@@ tor , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is only five @-@ fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible on the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a fifth in a conventional and a sporty GT version .
in the trade , he arrives at the beginning of the year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan subscri@@ ber wants to find its position in the highly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti adap@@ ts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the DS 4 compact @-@ mounted model , which is visible on the I@@ AA .
on the outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er first laid hands on the front part : the radiator gr@@ ille was re @-@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology were fitted .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed above all , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , a series of over@@ work and new variants , such as the refres@@ hed Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cells are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has been in charge of an ex @-@ prisoner of the law enforcement agency Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this decision has made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suffer@@ ers may even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer , was transferred to a larger cell .
his official detention centre , due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the State of Berlin , failed .
but the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for renewed examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons for the question@@ able period only a few days of arrest for the compensation were decisive , an equ@@ ation was given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a short@@ ening of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber Court now has to clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
thus they spoke to a prisoner of compensation until April , because he was naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff took place between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to pun@@ ches should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young deficiency , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany ?
about 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany following the predi@@ ctions of the Federal Ministry of Germany this year , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can create this and we create this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as previously built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all at affordable rental properties : from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments from the rental price binding , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
much too little is the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments each year would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is likely that 55 percent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany wouldn &apos;t be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises the project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the record company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , there was a political change according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour .
while in the past there was a ban on labour for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residen@@ cy , the asylum seek@@ ers limited to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , it is also clear that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster .
a major obstacle to access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge .
until now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts .
the building of networks is therefore based on the view of Thr@@ än@@ hardt the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few parents spend their children in Kit@@ as , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the parents &apos; roots it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration is distributed in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - about by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students are prepared without knowledge of German in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage in them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ cases from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Federal State says asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude .
willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ances do not receive benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law more if they start studying .
the latter generally does not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ iti @-@ entitled persons .
patient @-@ toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to short@@ fall this span to 15 months .
but this gap must also be closed , for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will continue to play an important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely clear the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches right to develop a new state religions relationship .
it is also important that the establishment of an Islamic welfare federation , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers professionally .
duties are also part of the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to work together with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arabic .
integration will be much more than today a topic of society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point for a decade and a general equality law .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU assass@@ ination series showed that the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organizations and the interests of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and why international agreements like anti @-@ rac@@ ism prevention Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years , if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical services to the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all arri@@ vals at the same time when regi@@ stering health maps .
these services could later be attributed to the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited capacity of power to see the asylum seek@@ er law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the doctors are doing the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in hospitals , as well as in medical practices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
for example , among refugee children there is much more un@@ common disabilities , and with young people it is about HIV enlighten@@ ment .
but with some of the other diseases German doctors come from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ it@@ ory or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly undergo tests again .
at least half of the refugees coming in Germany is psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study conducted by TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart attacks and dead@@ lines .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong el@@ ong@@ ation and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
until now , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy .
although mentally ill seek@@ ers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ estimates , says Mun@@ z .

for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the family is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to take away people from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with w@@ it and charm in their spell .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the St@@ um@@ m@@ Films , the Cub@@ an Duo wants to absorb the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art on the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .

W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string of matches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the man@@ ege .
so the highest bid : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or a hundred spectators , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September every day .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also v@@ ested by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany the speech of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ enbach .
last month they had borro@@ wed him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , President and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger than it is HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual sales and will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s explanation .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in order to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring in order to overcome the conversion of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history its participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury threat@@ ens not the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd investig@@ ates 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 lig@@ ad@@ els in the last five playing times .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that it has been one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need to take a little break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al has clear favor@@ ites , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has pulled the lesson from the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by the far@@ away hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never folded in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced in 2015 as the year of man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at cost intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
every character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ ines through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when playing football in cozy arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can relate to it , even though they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
as a staff of phone past@@ oral care it told me : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed me really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone can also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit this weekend comedy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone at Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to dem@@ ol@@ ish Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head ball@@ tor at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , Paris also needs a strong start against Swedish masters , because they not only asp@@ ire to qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he later became part of the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that could hold a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided at its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who was taken to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why when he was running in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he closed to Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Cel@@ tic hit a play @-@ off to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was hei@@ ghtened by a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes insi@@ sted on , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who didn &apos;t wait for less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er achieved his sixth year of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before the waiting list Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized by the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games do not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects 2.5 billion $ by stock sales
the mining giant that is based in Switzerland , which is affected by the shortage of raw materials prices , collected 2.5 billion $ on Wednesday as part of its huge debt relief plan .
the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value in this year , struggles with falling raw materials prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and dis@@ astro@@ us markets .
in the early Wednesday morning , the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced last week the 2.5 billion US stock sales as part of the more comprehensive plans to destroy around one third of its $ 30 billion debts .
the company sold the new shares to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have decreased iron ore prices around half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i Jin@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and re@@ jects President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also be hosts of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state D@@ iner after the two leaders have led bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ i &apos;s visit will be able to expand the American Chinese collaboration with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i will give the opportunity to construct areas of dis@@ agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was announced at first in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i will address a number of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding the alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar for summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago prior to the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion champion champion , two times club world champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now advis@@ es that he already stood before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason why X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has given me this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns had run 2008 / 2009 with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the royal classes triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday Night von H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it with the filling of the film and not at the occupation of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with imp@@ aired un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian joined .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove that is struck by her white starter .
the producer of Dear White People sat for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directed rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain her diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a point where exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the foref@@ ront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves achieved nation@@ wide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to command discri@@ min@@ atory practices against col@@ oni@@ alism .
in February the singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; album quiet matter &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ esses who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation , or has already met the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport climbing and user assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million home .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to shut down all levels of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who completed the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of the win of the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had lived for life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he did not end the course at all , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , it receives the great gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gro@@ ll about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt just as if they had dec@@ eived the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for a mixed season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
once they were one of the best teams in the Bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb up in a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scores three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ings and allowed three branches .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two branches , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit play by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on 6 July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has swe@@ pt the head@@ wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better from the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three races at the end of the seventh Inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to return to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ ny , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who tore a two @-@ run from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the conclusion @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League &apos;s 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Detroit added a insurance run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings , the wall made a R@@ BI dou@@ bles against the c@@ aller of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed piano made S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth P@@ FC .
Detroit benefited from the beginning of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three branches in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game by the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing for more than one month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches since in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game that managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single one on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was not particularly well beaten , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there came to three races with six hits and a walk with four ke@@ yst@@ outs .
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled by the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since August 20 because of a gu@@ err@@ illa in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees should be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in this area are to be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden said on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital had been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they will then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse according to the pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he designed the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collec@@ tively &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the cup had passed a military stake in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict broke out in front of our door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on site for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station ORF , to Hungary , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany has not sent refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is agreed so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of an agreement where Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Safety and Repres@@ entative of Germany .
concrete figures did not call them and rejected talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann applied for a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet met a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee belt in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , they also complain .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective cannot remain in Germany either .
this view was expressed unanim@@ ously in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge force effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans route .
Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia during the night .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest , including the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ gs from escap@@ ing over Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants report@@ edly went on the way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean swe@@ ars .
this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; spac@@ ecraft .
this means that the moon easily de@@ moun@@ ts on its path around the ring planets .
although this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said to be a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for a long time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 that sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not resolved .
R@@ ama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
around one month in 1860 , Munich has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an investigation carried out an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presum@@ ably means four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential obligation of a compatible pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties first presented a def@@ ensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was formerly under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove its ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ sten Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training after his bra@@ ins sha@@ ken next week .
already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is expected to go into running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent coll@@ ision at the head .
contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a grave cens@@ or@@ ship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slim line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ gos , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
the shell colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
you should store at room temperature and consume within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special note .
it soft@@ ens the slightly bitter taste of some bl@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ates like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US package service U@@ PS presents up to 9@@ 5,000 pay@@ outs for the Christmas business in the USA .
with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
above all , drivers are sought .
last year , U@@ PS had exposed his workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 out of aid .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor Fed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions past the past year to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the parcel service to harsh criticism .
first F@@ öhn@@ sturm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the night@@ mar@@ es of the f@@ öhn winds through , like Mete@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and on the night on Thursday , the hair @-@ dryer blows partly with storm strength by the com@@ promis@@ ers .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning , a striking cold front crosses us , the powerful ra@@ inf@@ all , wind arches and a drop in temperature .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure .
on the mountain@@ side of the Alps breaks through the valleys in the night to Wednesday .
in the after@@ math of the F@@ öhn winds up to Thursday morning in the F@@ öhn@@ t@@ valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can pass through to the adjacent centre of the middle , and even or@@ kan@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on Wednesday night@@ fall hair dryer for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ew at the Alpine slope .
here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , South of the Alps has to be counted in the next 48 hours with some more than 100 litres of rain per square metre , this after the last days there are already big ra@@ inf@@ alls .
on Thursday morning , the air escap@@ es , in which a cold front rolls with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind refres@@ hes strong to stor@@ my temperatures , and temperatures go back significantly .
the following days are present in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend it will sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of the City President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the Park on the Opp@@ io hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ formers .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the work community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could only live in their faith for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , in a symbolic way , the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) proved to be a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city at that time as a welcome sin @-@ b@@ abel .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions should have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
with his thes@@ es , Luther had initiated the split of the Western Church with his thes@@ es .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous images .
at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs has formulated his completely personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that deal with topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or father@@ land .
with this he has spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who based on painting with the respective Scrip@@ tures .
he interpreted the Scrip@@ tures selected by Ot@@ mar and thus translated into current context . &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical passages of Martin Luther and each one of the artist who formulated his own personal thoughts about the situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the reed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out to bear me again with the Lord Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to make art more important in the fast @-@ life time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is characterized by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer fall into the pictures , &quot; let them work , discover and sense which force they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ay stood on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not pay attention to capture the Bible completely , but the most important , also mysterious themes selected for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
plans made , place found , companies mand@@ ated , Erd@@ hü@@ gel model@@ ed for a round course : a year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration were responsible for dr@@ ills , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the railway .
so hill dep@@ orted , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will be made in October , the first joint go@@ ddess Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now share in the child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees up to 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga places a clear sign on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures politics its help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since the unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for each individual to get this issue into the grip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive course has to place politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German So@@ ccer League therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach stated on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they are on the left @-@ hand jer@@ sey instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports chef Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody is allowed to take away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
on Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ ens@@ ing clubs in their places had started their own projects is great .
just as great it is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP member of the Executive Board loses an eye on accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye through a crash at the beginning of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he had worn in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost blood@@ less , was power@@ less , and then went out to the street - that he told us last week , &quot; says the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Platt@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully labour @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ its between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you are fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Re@@ placement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from Skir@@ mish ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , during the last weekend in Singapore , he is just as little as reservations for the two regular pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in@@ query , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ ell with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only alter its stem eleven on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change in the gate position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of stem keeper Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European League games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open .
with a high probability , he will also deny the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ sche statement by Mit@@ Player Re@@ us , that the final turn for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Marco Wei@@ gl , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants pioneering role for Germany
Germany should be a technological leader after the federal government &apos;s will .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Autom@@ ation@@ I@@ AA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA .
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , stresses the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid change on digital radio .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks can be applied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the fact that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver .
when automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , driving vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are expected to be expected far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany are estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA @-@ based survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the decree Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years , 31 per cent believe at all .
in France , 21 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed cars are expected by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads .
on the free@@ way , it would like to imagine 15 percent in flowing traffic , at the St@@ au 45 percent .
well , every v@@ ist would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
from 25 September to 4 October , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to apply only in sing@@ les .
the final decision is to fall at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 year old German master is expected to go back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste to J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo has been missing , and we have become Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world rank@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has drawn up a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and that he stuck men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant who am Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( from the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18 September at Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his position at the beginning of a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a little after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal , Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ das . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work , for which much effort was carried out : to fres@@ hen the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged .
according to the course of the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have taken 14 tons of material .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather pants out@@ fits with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , sha@@ ky fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later joined the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first own fashion show he didn &apos;t have to pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener lace as fashion niche
in the past , it went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were produced in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
today , this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the car seats .
instead , fashion is again important again .
in the early days of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lin@@ dustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past stit@@ ches , is increasing the potential .
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales were broken off .
private specialized shops and wholesale markets are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
the bulk goods are produced much cheaper nowadays in the Asian region , and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
in addition , the export , current to Russia and the USA .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ er@@ isches Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Art - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why an existing design will often only vary slightly in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ bu@@ ked the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine sti@@ ls small spheres in some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister@@ in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by : &quot; I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ ro@@ undings and who want to make a souven@@ ir .
so I see my jewellery as modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legends should not be stir@@ red , but Disney still dar@@ es to a new film of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , according to the &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not a re @-@ fil@@ ming , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
but the director is already saying : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .

EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thereby acquire a significantly higher dose of nerve activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received an appropriate working paper in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force on pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values for large fish should be raised at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , big pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so strongly imp@@ acted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the length may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be inde@@ b@@ ted .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fishes , such as car@@ p tend to be so low , that they already hold the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ance de@@ fle@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for the human being , which is strongly stimul@@ ated by the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly inf@@ ants of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains its homepage with regard to the prevailing maximum values , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cannot be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury gets primarily through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants viol@@ ate the Green Par@@ liament@@ ary Con@@ federation Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March had c@@ ited out of paper .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
