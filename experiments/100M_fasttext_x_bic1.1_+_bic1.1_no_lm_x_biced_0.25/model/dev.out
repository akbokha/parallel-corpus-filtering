Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and T@@ eh@@ ran dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but it should also be a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington acc@@ uses Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and poses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal made by Obama to deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can before the US Congress , which was partly seen as an aff@@ ront against Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election forth@@ coming in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor was asked to have shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officers had to come to his home .
it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house , the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University , Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford , said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb did the dis@@ astro@@ us distress at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cled him .
one day after the shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the State , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ us died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both were taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ inations to troubles@@ ome behaviour .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said , he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he obtained his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met together by common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the flock of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls f@@ used when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and live in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ us obviously had some time together .
in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ us , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they had been divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ us , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both coming up on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together with one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ us was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ us Night at night 5 September for the last time when he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ wache , while the University &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans carried out this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot down Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss referred to as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
toys R Us plan to set fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that it will not hire as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 4@@ 0,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 4@@ 5,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with interview talks this month and the number of employees from October to December is rising .
while the holidays themselves are still months away , the Christmas business is getting near@@ er , and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equi@@ p stores with employees that sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox defe@@ ats his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to me in the sense that I &apos;m a simul@@ ated ya@@ wning and an arm &apos;s length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel movie ever made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation insol@@ uble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity when dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dism@@ issed him as a joke .
and some wait for a break .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys down@@ ward , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys have shown Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claimed Tr@@ ump probably won the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PAC@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and start to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a passing phase :
Tr@@ ump@@ ing@@ Posi@@ tions have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Io@@ wa stated last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P &apos;s GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans said they either were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of ten say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio at just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anger@@ ed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ ump@@ ump Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and ins@@ ul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish vot@@ ers ten@@ ding to the rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the State of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively accomplish his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temper@@ ament was not p@@ asse in the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
when they expose their ne@@ sts , rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers hold tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C , last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money to Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it appears that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers view tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ ump@@ et leadership while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he got 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have made their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say that they have fixed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rape , &quot; two months ago , the immigration of immigrants from Mexico was the turning point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump is going to keep decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post enquiry of Monday six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s at new high@@ s .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile , about half of the support of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers is eliminated , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Io@@ wa rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans are fru@@ strated about the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans in the Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea watt .
in the street , a square meter of a real estate building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers a square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student workshop in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top home types , however , one of the costs comes from pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nothing - per square meter , noted .
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champ@@ ions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
Tor@@ schüt@@ z in Pira@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one barrel .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller was p@@ aving the way for a well deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pira@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pira@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League by the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Miller &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Göt@@ z Hit ( 8@@ 7. ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth victory in series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received his 28th hit in the Champions League to lead to the Bavarian leadership of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left the world champion &apos;s thought commemor@@ ated as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised ahead of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans of hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without gl@@ it@@ ering .
Pir@@ äus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class , among them against renowned clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly in their offensive efforts , but often too inv@@ entive to work .
the attacks were often initiated by shifting to left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , who rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortunate from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 64@@ th minute the World Champion for@@ gave the potential 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , as Olympic champion Ide@@ ale Brown hit the ball of the Pol@@ es from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct acceptance , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians played their usual dominant game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set con@@ i@@ fer stit@@ ches .
but on the ke@@ epers Manuel Neuer was reli@@ ance .
so , for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ a over the Lat@@ te ( 56 . ) .
before new , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back to muscular problems in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6. ) and later made everything clear 13 minutes later , Mul@@ ler sat on it .
before the match it had come to the stadium in Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partially confused Bayern fans in their audience blo@@ c apparently had prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and proce@@ eded with bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , not only damage the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
the good news : when c@@ ited , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold higher .
the scientists had seen more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ ums , empha@@ sizes DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ si@@ zing the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent g@@ ing@@ i@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clari@@ fied to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years before the endanger@@ ing falls back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , head of study H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking short@@ ens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to the old age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness was affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental out@@ age .
the new long @-@ term study exam@@ ines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists run on the c@@ utt@@ le@@ banks of Cologne on rests of the late antique
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the building site for the new bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , said head of the museum Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ eological Reser@@ vation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now 5 .
from text documents had already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained .
next to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission propos@@ ing a new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to def@@ use the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement T@@ TIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ TIP will create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely show that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the USA and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against sentences .
until now , the parties involved agreed with each other on arbit@@ rators , there was no ob@@ jection to their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , they want to work on an International Investment Cour@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there might be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states , for example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , demanded above all by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against T@@ TIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ ism that companies pay compensation to tax@@ pay@@ ers , negotiate national laws , or en@@ force reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in initial statements Anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations like Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German econom@@ ist Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major step forward .
the Commission took into account significant points on the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) could be concluded on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer unten@@ able .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ stick .
the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of different places , which he repeat@@ ed@@ ely draws on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they originated and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative error .
with 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; smart@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent .
the rum@@ or is that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states of the United States should follow in a row .
but already 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive feeling .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a widespread masterpiece will be published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
captiv@@ ating ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board Charts and is not missing in any yearly list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic assembly pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this 6th ordinary studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
the stage shows have long since gone out of the smaller clubs , the stage shows are a colorful spectacle composed of Ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark@@ ly kept ham@@ burger see more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without jud@@ ging a word to the audience , the group performs excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
one h@@ ears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and it is possible to throw away the &quot; plate basically . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens only thank@@ ed for an enc@@ ore , played acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bowed with thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by the Prime Minister &apos;s Q &amp; A .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionn@@ aire and for the first time invest in David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to give the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is prob@@ able by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s guidance , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a comm@@ em@@ oration celebration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has prov@@ oked criticism from a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesperson said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling for differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liament@@ ary party originally supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; within Labour , and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour has made changes to remove the whole idea of a total .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and R@@ enten minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been the T@@ ory leader over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Cro@@ wd sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too con@@ front and that he will refra@@ in from focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow of Economic Affairs Minister , will represent him if he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Comm@@ ons , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ le @-@ Theaters , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und increases by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound went jump @-@ nicely according to data showing an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid target SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and raised assessment since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 by 0.@@ 84 % .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v entered .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore &apos;s shares increased by 5 % after the mining giant said he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the Packaging and Paper Industry of Mond@@ i were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his estimate for the Company Rating on &quot; sale . &quot;
JD Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sport@@ swear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of JD Sports says that higher sal@@ aries je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the CEO of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both - namely in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger i@@ mb@@ h owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the &quot; potato instead of d@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer .
the idea brought him a poster in a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had acci@@ dentally saw on TV .
since then , the store has a barbecue sk@@ e@@ wer equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea is that the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile arrived at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes contain the sk@@ e@@ wer .
only as much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds .
the culinary international understanding is also well received by its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Con@@ soli@@ dation Camp@@ aig@@ n to Com@@ bat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ ci@@ dent
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor stand campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when wholes@@ alers of food , alcohol and devices will conduct its annual Investor @-@ Strateg@@ ic Day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the East states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious Provin@@ cial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
anal@@ ysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take up about five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after the opening of his first markets and will take away sales of all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , anal@@ ysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed costs could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful ones .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales and food business fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , spoke at a business meeting in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , supplying about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt on sales and margins at the same time .
however , the wholes@@ aler still resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Chief Executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurb@@ ishment programs are going to grow with Elan and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Hu@@ gios and , according to the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; special Ks , &quot; got into the spot@@ light thanks to the not@@ orious confron@@ tation of Kyr@@ gios and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
soon after that , in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had Kyr@@ gios be beating , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kra@@ mp@@ f failed to win a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for finishing second in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite excited about is that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him and I think he has been treated a little too ti@@ ghtly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he &apos;s trained in dressing , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &apos;s important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term fixed part . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stop , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who were trying to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants tra@@ ded themselves in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted by Serbian officials with indig@@ nation .
the people fled from violence , stuck for an unknown time in a land strip at the road between the two control points of the states and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations rose .
when a helicopter hung over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian army police .
some returned from protest food and water .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations blo@@ c at a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ rum@@ ored Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy campaign by Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand in two southern regions called on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to emphasized that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire rope along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even pris@@ ons were deployed in the race to build the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage to the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for condemned human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which will be expected next week , but Rep@@ orters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Landes @-@ Security Ad@@ vis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ setting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to fix the fence swi@@ ft@@ ly .
Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to deal with people &apos;s data and squee@@ zed a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 succeeded to arrive , but thousands were outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to go to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit jump in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the primary elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 per cent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ did@@ ly for the President &apos;s Office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the primar@@ ies .
more than five months before the primary elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , still has a big advantage over the older vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit jump in the liberal , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the vot@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections across the country say that they would enthusias@@ tically support Clinton if they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because it is the nomin@@ ee .
six percent would not support them .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the Democ@@ rat vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the nomin@@ ee , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman president becomes ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also c@@ ited .
since the vice president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the or@@ phan@@ age , 57 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the primar@@ ies are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers more than half say that Bi@@ den would be far from being otherwise .
if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ did@@ ise for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead will be increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bees in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic vot@@ ers see Clinton as a nomin@@ ee with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased .
yet , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic vot@@ ers call questions about the vot@@ ability .
similarly as in the last month no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these vot@@ ers emerged as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important tra@@ its for vot@@ ers in the pres@@ election of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den best cuts off hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about it ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it .
in general , the democratic constitu@@ ents of the primar@@ ies also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ ers have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic elec@@ tors of the primar@@ ies are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not imp@@ acted their views altogether .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that her opinion of her had deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six out of ten who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this continues to be a problem for them under registered vot@@ ers overall : only 32 percent see them hon@@ estly and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 per cent of those entitled to vote see also Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good marks on leadership .
from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the pres@@ election amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in the nation@@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the vot@@ ers &apos; support is eliminated in the new pol@@ l , and others lose a dramatic halt .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers nation@@ wide . the support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted ahead of Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among rep@@ ubli@@ can vot@@ ers with university education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , has been beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place with 6 % .
the error margin of the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is entering the poll@@ s - with 19 % support for the Rep@@ ub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son raised in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side qui@@ vers for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tr@@ umps belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in Io@@ wa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ations in order to find even more warm water .
a dip in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , divi@@ ding the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt arrives at 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College Ne@@ ul@@ ing
almost two years after a student died during a decent ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft picked up Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital that contributed to his death .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with his blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained of head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and put the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
following an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least one student died since 1970 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of the third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of violent attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or officially - we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest is coming , and the c@@ ous@@ ins fall into sha@@ king , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , representatives of the US Central Bank have sharply stressed that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could see that all the excitement was probably exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level , to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a view on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets can be paid for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts in a later study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , head of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will tend to appear later in the increase in earnings and the return will begin to dimin@@ ish .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate rise of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases were only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and forecast for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all year round , market participants focused on a rise in interest in the F@@ ed , and all eyes focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all enlargement cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put forward after the beginning of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market anticipated an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds is quicker than in case of shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction once the initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increases cycle , the bond issues fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ists believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , Jones says that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit margins have expanded and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
in large and large companies , who handle the greater part of their business in the United States , benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high @-@ level capital returns and low volati@@ lity for their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are losing most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the mere stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sa@@ vers could see gains by higher yields , even if experts agree on how fast this will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples where you actually only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director dism@@ issed the alle@@ g@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 left far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education to the public .
what I am learning from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder would be made to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports was under fire to tramp@@ le on the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins att@@ acking The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated 22 million pounds .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced &quot; in a special BBC mode . &quot;
he added , he wished that the company &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; if the next time there was a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to include the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fee paid for other entertainment formats .
net sales grew slower in August and Black Friday may be responsible
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slo@@ wed the issues
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there are now signs that online sales stag@@ nate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stag@@ nate after new figures show just 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back until 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for decl@@ ining revenues .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases from this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers scar@@ ed their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where the buyers are fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of £ 5 expenditure a little more than £ 1 was issued online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the Mec@@ ca dead in the crane accident - B@@ in Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia reli@@ eves the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead approached their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ aissance cemetery .
the proc@@ ession went on in the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beds .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the B@@ in Laden &apos;s family left a san@@ ction due to the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 bet@@ s killed , when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram of Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage than the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia has already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today king Sal@@ man , the B@@ in Laden group , would not have let the arm of the crane stand when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the B@@ in Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was out@@ la@@ wed abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the Great Mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ res@@ h , who later took place this month .
the B@@ in Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ opped the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded by Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project run by the B@@ in Laden Group .
the B@@ in Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and has acquired major construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dissi@@ dent son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British employ more and more craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops target@@ ing professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q points at the same time
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Head correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its settle their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European tra@@ des@@ men carrying out their work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority today .
for the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has meanwhile sur@@ passed .
for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and closing 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are hit by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; still a majority of men are working in our branches .
we must shift this more strongly to a balance .
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company occup@@ ying exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and finance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
King@@ f@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group o@@ wed the costs for closing the stores .
because of the trend King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vic@@ tor A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and bi@@ d@@ ding involvement in the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to Chief Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ all@@ ised himself in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants used funds for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions .
he c@@ ited the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also charged for financial failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Sch@@ öff@@ ens@@ en@@ ate , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired from this fact .
it shall be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
in order to reject the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence stated that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen to the association .
the sports officials had only compens@@ ated for expenses and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and in which they invested a lot of time and money , the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were facing the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread @-@ profession of the financial officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant , he decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have fin@@ ed money , put our life insur@@ ances down to the bank for safety , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to pay any debts .
furthermore , in the event of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expenses compens@@ ations had been resolved retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense reimbur@@ sement was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus in the account was paid .
therefore , l@@ ump sum and non @-@ detailed accounts also appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the two def@@ end@@ ants shared the accounts and pass@@ book @-@ books , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
the judge asked why the withdrawal was not dis@@ closed to the association in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financing of finance , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when investigations were conducted against the one functional investigation for abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were back@@ ups , declared the def@@ end@@ ants .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know what to answer for a long time .
then he said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ accused had been informed , justified the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , Jud@@ ge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ end@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary told him that he never paid a cent salary , he just calculated o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ ets .
he charged the club 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expenses were much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants could not provide accurate documentation for the early years .
these were no longer kept after a test in which everything had been correctly judged , they declared .
kilomet@@ re allowance was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all dwell@@ ings are in cash , and he explained in his statement from his place of residence international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg .
the trial will continue on 23 September with witnesses of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard stands up to another 30,000 jobs
in addition to personnel cuts running for the past three years , the Compu@@ Ser@@ b will reduce additional jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) have no end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the disman@@ tling of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will result in a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been concluded for the past three years .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard share gave up 2.3 percent on the stock exchange .
the company , which has grown up with printers from the California Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services continued to be the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to be the latest .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
in this way , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man re@@ acted late that customers buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and buy more and more shops online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of some 5@@ 5,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in hos@@ tilities in Iraq would , however , be overwhel@@ m@@ ingly rep@@ udi@@ ated : 54 per cent said , on the other hand , 35 percent agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , find 61 percent positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has declined by 51 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed , 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion of Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used several hundred refugees on the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ shed .
Eur@@ one@@ ws correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and a water@@ shed was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles after the police officers .
the officials initially put a stop to Pfe@@ ffer@@ spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now with@@ drawn somewhat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried .
other refugees stra@@ pped in and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time in almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current level will last from 0 @-@ 0.25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate has been NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced on Thursday at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday .
sentenced to death at Delta State University
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday .
police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lectur@@ er for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He killed someone , and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he told the staff of the emergency centre that the police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
lamb did not give an explanation for his shots .
when police stepped into the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ us , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , he went 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen sm@@ iled him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb alleged that Pr@@ enti@@ us also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ us was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ us would have a daughter who is 19 and she is &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ us were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ us worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ us by Sun Her@@ ald .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ us , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , had lived with Lamb for about three years .

stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ time partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor suppos@@ edly has to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was con@@ vic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly demands its toll .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the work of the Group .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Euro@@ wings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million a year from cost and proceeds syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline shared on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a board member for the passenger business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings budget airline should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the Management Board of Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with its new position Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
until now , the organisation of the 120@@ ,000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new Neg@@ oti@@ ations with pilots
in the tari@@ ff conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations shall be res@@ um@@ ed after the scheduled strike on this Thursday .
this was the case with the union .
the topic of the talks should be the reig@@ ning regime for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predic@@ tive record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will come into viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
in addition to the transi@@ tional supply of the pilot , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept .
it is clear that Lufthansa out@@ sour@@ ced routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double fra@@ cture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fra@@ cture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven &apos;s Champions League defeat at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outer def@@ ender to cry and decided to exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has double leg fra@@ cture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic plays , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I am not a doctor , but if you have double Fra@@ ktur , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group stage .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and a penalty of an El@@ f@@ metre .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alised the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an i@@ vory and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intent of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt his opponent , and when you hear that there is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very bad at it . I &apos;m so sorry about it .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - following a f@@ oul@@ spiel by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron understands The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ able published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it seems always to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything beautiful and good , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is suppos@@ edly describing the plot of the book , instead returns a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Z@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this were not susp@@ icious enough : the text proposed by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy h@@ ears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , shr@@ ill @-@ looking On@@ ce @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a shr@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who didn &apos;t read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text was probably from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s constitu@@ ency office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test plane , is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th runs out of the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are gear@@ ed towards results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , we could have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , if he hopes for more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even though he did not receive such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test schl@@ ager gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven odds - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton scored nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first set Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a drummer I reck@@ on with .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
it must have at least the same chances as those before it , but this naturally depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting Mo@@ een next to Cook , what an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler would perform and receive four qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed guy has already shown that he &apos;s a devil &apos;s l of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately made three hundred rounds and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there &apos;s no large number of backup sp@@ ins that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful dedication to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ lah he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy went into a flo@@ od@@ light until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s non @-@ fer@@ mented re @-@ negoti@@ ating strategy to hold Great Britain in the EU will go deeper into trouble with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought fier@@ cely for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , as deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s self @-@ created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive contract changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let &apos;s see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals , no matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened for the exagger@@ ated long as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ zz@@ ling power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will take a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better deployed to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they do not want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
for this reason , some of these ministers may even deliberately plan not helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our admission 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can weak@@ ly remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s .
with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones @-@ h@@ ack@@ ering foreigners and the P@@ seu@@ do non @-@ In@@ länder , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but noticed that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had challenged the principle of the not adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press never for@@ ba@@ de him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems at risk of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , an error back then and today .
it may take but he has to develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I really express it - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ eb@@ ar@@ b trend and the wil@@ der Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus can certainly say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ out fought in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the prov@@ oking John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad law firm .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet @-@ job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their clearing day on Monday evening .
whatever the stir@@ ring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has stir@@ red me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV all around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , such as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among lef@@ tist dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful vot@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ cutting of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive verification of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et received the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily in@@ significant foundation &quot; at which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed verification of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BAT ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BAT to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to get funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports of the tobacco company Philip Morris International added them .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not supplied , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the Tob@@ acco leadership of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most of the products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; he claims that &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he said that he was already re@@ acting to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addi@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should quit East@@ bourne , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ disp@@ uted time slots against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like B@@ BC@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent that would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communication committee within the framework of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t think in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least rely on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class window because they want to reach as broad support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense , of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ afri@@ ca is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am anxi@@ ous to see how this is supposed to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think that would reduce the BBC in general .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that BBC &apos;s fault in the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell shows like East@@ afri@@ ca .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs &quot; should go to B@@ BC@@ 4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check , educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and maintain its Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission . &quot;
he said that little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , clearing up and enter@@ tained &quot; to the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers Alli@@ ances to make all available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction in the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on motor neur@@ ons , which are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels which react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani discovered that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microsc@@ opic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms in such a way that some of their motor neur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
when using ultrasound on the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubble and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the altered mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily charge the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stations and metro trains , requiring a second look .
&quot; important announcement : depart from 15 to 18 September with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) read in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a tank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September a flock of arms dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers are asked to help at the stop of the arms trade fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cru@@ el Designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys , claimed by &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

one of the par@@ ody ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according G@@ avin Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lectur@@ er at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and attempt to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists take part in protest movements to work and realize that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapon trades @-@ posters gre@@ ets the comm@@ uting in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who works for free as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around advertising for the Ar@@ ms Trade Fair - through a le@@ asing of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic ten@@ ant corporate advertising , but &quot; with bright colours and animation it stays stronger . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is an invasion of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair is from the area within Excel , where exhibitors f@@ lin@@ t fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have upset - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance to student residen@@ ces ranges from easy to nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ ud@@ dle : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken sab@@ bath days , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite don &apos;t love or hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
leave people .
people &apos;s rooms often change into beverage recipes , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship with your university .
intro@@ vert receives a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I love you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you must go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
ph@@ asing an@@ pro@@ pos : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a not locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
making friends through baking .
as you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have something baked to you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and at the end perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ ers .
bad mixed l@@ umps made of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping asleep when you tap .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk holder .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my sympathy , but try to handle them more balanced than my room@@ mate who added their milk to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b you belong to the people sitting in the gl@@ ass@@ works .
a girl on my cor@@ ridor asked her neighbours if they had something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter because it was three in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to it with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to be in the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be bot@@ her@@ some embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , to go to her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps see how she moves all together with her friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your under@@ head a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice someone has his key in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good trick is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by plug@@ ging into a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and put your keys in a glass of water which you put in the freezer - but stap@@ le their pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
row houses for refugees , single persons , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is construc@@ ting terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of the corner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees too - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build economically and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are coming to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly inexpensive hab@@ itation can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
people stay here for a great deal .
in view of the flow of refugees , we also need enough living space in the coming decades .
a completely ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least space .
it facilit@@ ates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
guil@@ ds : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have dra@@ gged my project correctly .
in particular , it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ gad@@ get special construction and the placement of the parking space .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under construction , who in a row house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the less @-@ deser@@ ved .
I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well @-@ built today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , type in &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may involve del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able through the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is close to a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch on half way and this could lead to a break@@ out of the update .

in addition to consult@@ ations , courses can also be held there .
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely , the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchase market , you will immediately receive senior citizens and counsel@@ ing information on questions such as care insurance or services of the health and care insur@@ ances .
for years , with our out@@ patient care service , we have established that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many benefits of the insur@@ ances are not seldom understood because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager responsible for the work of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers of the Seni@@ or@@ enz@@ entrum and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , fores@@ ight and rehabilitation .
Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis , described the senior centre for care and care .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is especially reflected in demographic change .
this necess@@ it@@ ates a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social meeting . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and as good as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9@@ am to 2@@ pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

one of these men then scre@@ amed the young man and struck him on his f@@ ist .
the victims suffered a nos@@ eb@@ and and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ ased on the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
from his friends , the injured young man was brought home .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and drove past several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured moved in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the aid of a punch stand , one was exam@@ ining the face and th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical treatment .
until now , only a v@@ ague typ@@ ing description is available .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was cloth@@ ed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and As@@ endor@@ f , mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ steh@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich succe@@ eds in the next few months with a half @-@ point to the side .
after a re@@ development phase Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us Street 6 .
it was sympathy at the first glance when the rock formation years ago met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her vocational training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and wants to get into practice as early as the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the rub@@ b@@ ish would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot;
the idea was to run their own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss .
and so one agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the two @-@ time father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hanover followed by stations in several doctor &apos;s practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . in 2009 he was appointed as Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 onwards , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon works as a family physician Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alizes in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a resident doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaker room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of € 500@@ 00 will be provided by the rub@@ b@@ ish in the context of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ ausen every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in As@@ endorf there is another house doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy stays in As@@ endorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
if no successor would have found himself , she would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos; consultation hours also look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the rock walls .
with their f@@ arewell in As@@ endorf an era ends , after all the medical professionals have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel fel@@ steh@@ ausen rec@@ alls sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long time , she already felt a little sad@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients very often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the gar@@ rison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband adds laugh@@ ing : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
it is still clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum can do this as a matter of course .
the supply and safety of the people is in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled course of action .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia rather will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - particularly Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already well controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to limit its borders to refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out his commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian Government ha@@ sten@@ ed , the first refugees in the night hours had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d border crossing to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police were able to seize them in nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has been gathering police cars with new refugees ever since .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country hosts around 4,000 refugees , Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said .
according to the media reports , in the early morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town Si@@ d , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could indeed be the predicted shift of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat far@@ ther west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees according to plans for possible exceptional circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia is a member of the EU since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently witnessed a good testimony regarding the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , 300 refugees continue to hide behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he ob@@ tains the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be a matter of very high refugee figures at the moment .
it is not possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of having obtained an overview of yet un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der stores should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the investig@@ ators have report@@ edly been in a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the S@@ EC Communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other def@@ end@@ ants in the case lasted .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are alleged to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce assistance Mannheim exists for 20 years

puls@@ ating , pr@@ un@@ ing life with splendid autumn sunshine and in the middle four big tables with the head@@ line &quot; Before I die I want to ... &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid has drawn attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is perfectly confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations as the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser @-@ by spontane@@ ously attacks the chal@@ k and adds the sentence around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper by the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer long , &quot; others stay short , read , say phrases like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are little discussions about the action on themselves , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on @-@ site .
&quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ac@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , who is working with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband Fle@@ et of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid .
that is why this public @-@ effective action for the 20 year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wants to share on the tables publicly , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the issue of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , according to the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to opening up people .

when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was looking for volunteers by calling , she immediately reported that she was involved in the founding in 1995 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce of Saint Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Fed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ drive service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share was more than 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. granted a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predi@@ ction .
according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set , anal@@ ysts expected 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view is despite the price increases , which reach an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4th and despite higher supplements for bo@@ d@@ land transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and because of growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid income when considering the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex was earning $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research &apos;s anal@@ ysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six anal@@ ysts questioned Z@@ acks expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , Fed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation shipping , which brought the sales in its unit Express shipping to stag@@ nation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results with Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre @-@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on its most expected congress in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise the benchmark for the first time since almost a decade .
above them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story session hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the nation &apos;s economic interests ahead of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : to maxim@@ ise U.S. employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third Mand@@ ate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could fri@@ ghten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and is also only a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head of the management company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which makes the financial markets uns@@ ett@@ led .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg predicted a rise in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position , unless the strateg@@ ists mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that further increases are far from it .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average rose by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy has maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she must go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rise in interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good way to increase the set by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen , in spite of the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als , had said that more economic progress would be needed to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs slo@@ wed in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation went constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets all over the world picked up its currency by the end of the month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , with the D@@ ow now almost 10 % lower than May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation of when interest rates should be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ cts that she will wait at least a month to get better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be considered technically at its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed has become the F@@ ed monetary authority in the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere indication of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion triggered del@@ usions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , observed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , ple@@ dged to raise interest rates in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives rever@@ ted these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest on interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she fears an increase in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act always bears the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living aid for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
making a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she also always likes to learn with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she is doing the asylum seek@@ er at the Dill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , the whole of other classes is at a proper school .
Rio Grande Pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Society encourages healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women is actually affecting the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for the solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn@@ around construction on the Bern@@ ried Sports ground is progres@@ sing step by step : in the last council session the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
prior to that , among other things , the committee had decided to apply for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; resp@@ . &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ centered first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; Liber@@ ation &quot; it was again about the prop@@ ens@@ ity of the roof , which is to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - differently than in the development plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan in regard to the prop@@ ens@@ ity of the roof does not permit any &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ried Municipal Council is generally more restri@@ ctive in the case of liber@@ ating moti@@ ons .
however , it is not a recur@@ ring project in the construction of gymnas@@ tics : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the sports centre at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and lati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter hall will be submitted to the administrative office for testing .
hospital Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital of Pei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , the Supervisory Board decided to make a decision , and it will be postpon@@ ed to Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans are implemented , then all of the 50 staff will be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are present .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , a work@@ station is to be offered to the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ts .
the staff were informed about the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik for the first time since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who is to follow the succession , who agreed to take charge of the management from October 1st and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the Sch@@ ong@@ au House this was in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alis@@ es in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner Station .
over the next two years , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es with its team , if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to both houses , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ank , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 if the current rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ours that the House , which is owned by the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted that there were several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the le@@ ch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen worked as chief physician for over 30 years have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital of Pei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand @-@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar @-@ Li@@ ons are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the League leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arro@@ gance .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener covered a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and got something good there .
Jag@@ ap@@ ark with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use , as the police informed .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought into hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was un@@ clear at first .
the criminal police investig@@ ates .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old who had been missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate for Saturday .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old killed the young people and threw their cor@@ pse into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the cor@@ pse of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police said on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is also considered as susp@@ icious , who according to the statement said and conducted the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home after visiting an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met with the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the cor@@ pse into the canal .
on Wednesday , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators gave him a blow to the load .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the further investigation is to bring about the closer circumstances of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need lodging : study warns of housing
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long ago begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers coming from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the &quot; Social Housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association is commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany this year .
this leaves 14@@ 0,000 apartments .
refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
many then stum@@ ble across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rented apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit that is growing from year to year .
currently some 77@@ 0,000 units were missing in the con@@ urb@@ ations , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many working people therefore stayed in large cities not@@ with@@ standing WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed un@@ will@@ ingly in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the flo@@ od@@ gates on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has fallen for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
this way , the real estate tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dised flats may be temporarily suspended .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary , according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for refugee hou@@ sings of the Kf@@ W State Bank is already well underway in cities and congreg@@ ations .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project might even be exposed .
refugees have free access : Croatia and Slovenia turn down cor@@ ridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no transit more , as more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if it is necessary we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the dep@@ ortation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RTL .
on the day before , Hungary had sail@@ ed its border to refugees .
new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically ob@@ sol@@ ete the ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning , Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus as well as with ta@@ xis to the Serbian border town Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to get to Croatia via the green border .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach border barriers .
but the border strip boasts other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , hardly any more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 36@@ 6 attacked people .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 93@@ 80 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws classi@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a criminal off@@ ense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned threatened sentences of up to five years and the dep@@ ortation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ onen &quot; limit set up on the border , of which almost all - 93 - the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there .
practically no one has a prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be dep@@ orted there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
gri@@ ds were disman@@ tled and one of the detention centres in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself at the goal of this conversion .
only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to the government .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy clearing out ten people at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and cut the frame together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
first of all , we had the un@@ expect@@ edly cancelled guests once , with snacks and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the delayed train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE to a regional train in direction of Pass@@ au , in order to try it after the short notice that rail traffic was stopped in Germany , but still to try the border .
but the regional train was put off at the river Inn at W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday organised a double @-@ bridge movement - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of assi@@ sting R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially adopted the position of the Hungarian government in the ha@@ ze of National Soci@@ alism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter to make decent conditions for people who seek refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .

Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former mighty Raiff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen top @-@ up centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday could also be accommod@@ ated without great confusion , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot;
however , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodation units must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a wet without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the tri@@ bun@@ es .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria , it &apos;s fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Card@@ inal Christoph Schön@@ born , to clarify how the church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also has great expectations in the ORF campaign &quot; Help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to hold a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he founded Konrad with his experience .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er don &apos;t charge the Republic as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own search for district search hasn &apos;t been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better allocation
the city of Linz is not planning an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design centers for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the victims are currently without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations should be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city boss is critici@@ zing the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts will also have to make their contribution .
seal : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a prolonged telephone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) took on the further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ o@@ fer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special moves with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the asylum seek@@ ers would , however , be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing inspec@@ tions to its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial area is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT company S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT , the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire .
from the very beginning S &amp; D wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
€ 1.7 million have been invested by S &amp; D in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is lease from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metre rest area in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the main focus of the new shop .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ada : after all , she now grew up in the form of another business local .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around the ladies &apos; pockets of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been re@@ developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I wonder@@ ed if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a special location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large @-@ room Linz that sells this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have Italian roots themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look in rap@@ ture at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the trade @-@ woman cannot answer with last security .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag upgrades every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ me @-@ Man from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer &apos;s ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself to be a stranger , a journalist or a kno@@ wle@@ d@@ geable gap in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office stimul@@ ated the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some in the 1200 inhabitants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; village is related to him over sixty corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election combat mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt nature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous sho@@ ots , among which besides Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also in the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the don@@ or , she says .
from the village of the en@@ co@@ ders , Tr@@ ump is coming .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film @-@ start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken of Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to fri@@ ghten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it fails , this is not so person@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer in retirement sees the American rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ittle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pension Econom@@ ist Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters mention that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz von Heinz at a visit ended something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not wish the election , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the USA at the time of his grandfather had been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pen@@ ed even without the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12,@@ 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has not been any major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this dis@@ advantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 viewers in the five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9,@@ 000 .
today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number stayed behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
in August Today , Today , the average achieved an average of 3@@ 18.@@ 000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 .
until now in September , Sun@@ rise has an average of 34@@ 9,@@ 000 viewers at 3@@ 14,@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ousness of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ ated father , who decided to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had wonder@@ ed whether Thom@@ son could play a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 83@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) the new qui@@ z show hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e aver@@ aged 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 until 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Seat ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ seat on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the odds of the second night of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Seat will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ run Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
Lana E@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in sec@@ rec@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you might in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently have given a hint of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should keep W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could become the game destro@@ yer who won the Bach@@ el@@ ors &quot; heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly called them - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and I noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt they were pretty compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth at both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay told her that last week &apos;s visit made it clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not , she was pu@@ zz@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle marked great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams that sent requests after its impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a spin , as did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first Pun@@ t Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also into the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is a hall@@ mark that was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a po@@ orer start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free vot@@ ers demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn squ@@ at in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , if there were no correspon@@ d@@ ingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools ahead of collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free elec@@ torate will be held in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e until Friday .
quite different main themes were actually planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Cho@@ ose boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also called for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum systems : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are bri@@ dging nation@@ ally uniform standards of the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing away , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more competent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in large @-@ wall city should not fall below the table .
a long lasting tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) launched the pilot trial &quot; Inter@@ medi@@ ate level plus &quot; at 47 gramm@@ ar schools in which an extension of the secondary school secondary school was tested for three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums wanting this .
free travel to the G@@ 9 wherever desired .

4 people killed after police officers hit demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber floors into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ orted to rubber shells .
twenty polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber shells used , of which it is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confron@@ tation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern states , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ CP i say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
building site planned in the city
the grounds at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post will be re@@ build .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in direct neighborhood to the Old Post &apos;s Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
planned is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
which investor may come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts had yet been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring Road / corner of the Große Straße , already a few months ago bought and the building on it can be torn off .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the vacation settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den is taking shape .
the investor first presented plans for the project for the first time .
quite a few An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their vac@@ an@@ cies
for months it was negoti@@ ated , gre@@ iled , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who accused the investors and administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Behr@@ ends went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners , who had come into the meeting , produced the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and member of the board in advoc@@ ating advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also fears some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; entire bus loads must come in order for this to be reck@@ oned , &quot; says Schulz
but it is still open to what exactly one h@@ ect@@ are area of the former restaurant is happening .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were still variable .

Google starts dou@@ bling donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations appeal on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee flo@@ wn with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / can be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes tend to live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity treatments have proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ b@@ ular formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments about the same at 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was completely dissolved and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved by only one percent and in some cases with only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after surgery , A@@ 1@@ c average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at approximately 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in at A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mort@@ ality rate in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ omy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded more complete overcoming of diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years in obes@@ e people who had under@@ gone an obesity surgery compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have gathered these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love History plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a theme that currently attracts attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
so also in the recently released novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting above all for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was just a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , like real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing is being reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US dra@@ gged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of intake of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the past 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years that swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years who report po@@ ison@@ ous control centers reported from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
YouTube videos show how teenagers dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant only drink because of a cheap experience .
adolescents allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange frag@@ ran@@ ces that are very pleasing to children .
hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in inf@@ ants , a few sp@@ las@@ hes can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Emer@@ gency Stop Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ las@@ hes from a straw@@ berry @-@ sm@@ elling hand san@@ iti@@ zer at school , was brought to the clinic .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold which is legally considered to be drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ebook doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah slept their words and was unable to go when they arrived in the emergency room .
doctors supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had met her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very fri@@ ghtening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs nut , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol pois@@ oning , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario , after the swal@@ lowing of hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities &apos; employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
the police looked at the s@@ worn plan as &quot; p@@ onder@@ ing &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authority .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a tight win over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Cel@@ tic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths Pla@@ ys To@@ ge@@ ther about Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ia
rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mony at Cel@@ tic Glas@@ gow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontane@@ ously , insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confron@@ tation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football bor@@ es Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former mayor mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show any highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what interests them .
there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swear Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , there was a defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now standing at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly this way - but we have to go on .
we really need really the support of Cel@@ tic , because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton war@@ y at jan@@ u@@ ary transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer window is very different from the summer windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys to tro@@ t again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Donn@@ el@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive League victory giving them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ y &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of this kind won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK as a whole .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was above the 5.5 per cent of the U@@ Ks , as indicated by the figures of the Bureau of National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , the occupation in Scotland decreased by 12,@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later , except for late @-@ judicial intervention , I will see a man being put to death .
when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
as the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would provide a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications are available as places , there is a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery instead of deciding who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
whoever is selected will be able to observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she acknowledged that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been better formulated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of Pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police chase persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man from Per@@ th to hin@@ der the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday for a breach of domestic peac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned on a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
master@@ ly football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria integrity section and claimed that she was conducting a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cobal@@ t sw@@ ab tasting at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to be &quot; looked like to high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I long enjoyed it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I would like to walk through the raised head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that Moo@@ dy had to show the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy said on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a fraud .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their nos@@ es because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this make me think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave co@@ war@@ dly and makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t care for me , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ strations levels of the trainer have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to say that he could &quot; t@@ oss his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten master Black Caviar , described the race tags treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like this last night .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it had so on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy kno@@ cks back against ri@@ vals because of alle@@ g@@ ations on ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called cri@@ tique of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers allowed the Storm players &quot; Ring battle &quot; with his team during the high @-@ storm win in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a very cl@@ ums@@ y note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; pattern example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that she was only concent@@ rating on her &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team made him feel confident because they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is emerging again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything from our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real center of gravity , and that has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . so he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this repeat@@ ed@@ ely appears at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and re@@ members his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a ver@@ tex .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play as they .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos vs. Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are we p@@ auses and don &apos;t have any points ?
for me , it is the sched@@ ules .
when they mention us , it means that in one phase we will meet them .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ ver@@ tis@@ ement
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence on account of his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested in the last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America to Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the yacht harbour during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ long punishment for attempting to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café he could have been out of a harmless background .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 in order to achieve his release .

A5 accident at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tear@@ ing apart
in case of a coll@@ ision with three lor@@ ries on the Highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver had been seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn to the left at the last moment , as the police said .
the cab driver &apos;s cab broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage to the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of inde@@ cent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the bewil@@ dering news and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of and watched the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for search for in@@ appropriate images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ ghten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addi@@ ction - that he is ad@@ dic@@ ted to fri@@ ghten people .
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was sha@@ king and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also saw the in@@ consistent photos on the phone and con@@ front the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , to have in@@ consistent photos taken by children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on 25 January this year and did not appear before the Court for a hearing on March 24 this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g was not in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdi@@ ct by October to get background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted b@@ ail in this case , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
it was added before the date of judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user wai@@ ves small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up at the German @-@ Austrian border away from the major control points .
many of the hau@@ lers left the people on smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .
out on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the B@@ order river Inn in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and traffic guns to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration .
the Munich Hauptbahnhof ( Main Railway Station ) met again significantly more refugees , compared to the week of the week on Wednesday .
just until 8@@ am , some 700 people have arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : boom of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; is expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm oils in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm ocean air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful ief is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who in the past days was drawn from the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .

on Friday we can see the sun again .
the masses are doing it : every two years the car makers at the I@@ AA show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is especially moving to the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new regi@@ strations have fallen to this segment by the German Federal Office of Fuel ( Germany ) alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( Public Days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German auto industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is part of the brand &apos;s core .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
follow @ Fi@@ on@@ a@@ we@@ be@@ di@@ tor Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ essi@@ ans offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp up to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is at first only a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the I@@ AA .
and what will be added next to the Astra at the I@@ AA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ fe@@ eder wants to find its position in the highly @-@ growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines matches the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be launched in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which can be seen at the I@@ AA .
from the outside , the designer of the noble Citro@@ ë@@ n fe@@ eder pushed hands on the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the refurb@@ ished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres cell is deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the justice prison Te@@ gel , who was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally un@@ divided .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , is now on the loose foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his legal position on the grounds of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the Berlin land failed .
however , the Constitutional Jud@@ ges raised the verdi@@ ct of the Berlin Chamber of App@@ eal and rejected the case for further examination .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for the compensation were author@@ it@@ ative , an equ@@ ation was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cl@@ ash of the legal protection of the personality would be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they only spoke in April a prisoner of compensation , because he was imprisoned in a cell in the nude .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multi @-@ discipline of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy .
in addition to that , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 a decent housing .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case for over three months .
the pris@@ ons in Berlin have also been head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even to h@@ ass@@ le , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial black@@ mailing list 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the shortage of young persons , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating that &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even capable of taking up one million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the extraordinary challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we manage it . &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 35@@ 0000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed each year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space , however , is dramatic above all in affordable rental properties : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments come out of the rental price binding , and in order to apply these particularly favourable flats , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
at the same time , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically sought after their qualification in order to help them get started , &quot; says Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ unt@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ man , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise labour .
while there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , which restri@@ cts asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - there is a majority of the view that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market sooner .
lack of knowledge of German is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contact .
according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the building of networks is the king@@ path to the integration of labour .
the Berlin school administration has established that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ren@@ ched parents , it is only once very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ ema , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , administration manu@@ als are distributed in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators is rising sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of German are prepared in class of welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack , Be@@ ate says suit@@ cases from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Federal State does not toler@@ ate asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was Berlin , interior cur@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position .
admission to the university could be facilit@@ ated for admission to the university .
because refugees with a refund or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er bill when they start studying .
the latter basically don &apos;t get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the people entitled to the property .
patient refugees have had to live in Germany for four years so far , to be eligible to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 this span collap@@ ses to 15 months .
but this funding gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually grant the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches law will continue to develop into a new state of religion .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organisation , who takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers professionally .
duties also belong to the rights .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Muslim Central Council , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to blow up such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole of society .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , the exploitation of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination office and a universal equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NSU assass@@ ination series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German are demanding for a long time and who commit to international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism prevention Germany must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use its possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for advice to all new@@ com@@ ers at the registration of health cards .
services rendered could be ac@@ counted for later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors mainly make the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin @-@ based health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in hospitals , but also in doctors &quot; offices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
many of the refugees would also be helped with more general medical assistance centers in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , there are clearly more untreated disability among refugee children , and with young people it is about HIV @-@ clari@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but with the partially other clinical pictures German doctors come from their education , but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery writes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system , many refugees are even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly submit tests again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to estimates by the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , is particularly vulnerable to refugee children .
a recent study by the Munich University of Munich demonstrates that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong el@@ ong@@ ation and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees have received psych@@ otherapy .
while psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can apply for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the tile .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal instructor and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto of the current fashion production .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to am@@ a@@ ze is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are important to bring people away from their everyday lives and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ cocktail with a world @-@ city flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov Clo@@ wn Family captiv@@ ates the audience with w@@ it and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cub@@ an Duo wants to easily record it .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words , they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous salmon @-@ ben@@ ds , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst truly fascin@@ ate with sensitivity and artic@@ ulation .
balance on a ball with the unic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
people are fascinated and fri@@ ghtened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , how little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at his position : &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not doing well either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , are read by the eyes as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the man@@ ege either .
so the first commandment is : ensure good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra stu@@ ds , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst said : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and with all their heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst looks at his performances every day from 17 to 20 September every day .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe is holding wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell from a podium by a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly over the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with her .
last month they had borro@@ wed him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation in the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists according to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity ends in parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will likely disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and cost @-@ saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will divide into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and its services business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a strain of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the light of his history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten your career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases ever since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 league matches in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs that have had the most vulnerable days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns to a rotation within the team .
Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to continue by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; Camp@@ aig@@ n &quot; started last season .
the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale of 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson of the last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven away from the far @-@ away hope to lead the club to its first Europe Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never folded in the arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as demonstrated by suicide among young men on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the goal of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevented men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood &quot; , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally heal@@ thful friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the response is often more important than an important contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even though in reality isolation is domin@@ ating .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the cra@@ ving of Ross to Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold themselves to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and suicide is really clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am cop@@ ing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it shows clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit the weekend of Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the backdrop completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to sm@@ ash Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his debut against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ stadi@@ on on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French masters on their way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it is not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced with his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and to look back to our opponents even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 Draw at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defence before he closed down nicely in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ hes and bad connections , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped in the first half by no less than five attempts alone after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an &apos;s sixth year , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could get back into the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could keep low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was recognized at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat@@ s off in front of Paris !
it was a great game from them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore collects $ 2.5 billion through stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , who is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt relief plan .
the company Gl@@ enc@@ ore , registered in London , said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about EUR 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling raw materials prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and dis@@ astro@@ us markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought Gl@@ enc@@ ore &apos;s share price to the tip of the London Stock Exchange in the early Wednesday morning .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened up to 0.@@ 69 percent .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around one third of its $ 30 billion debts .
the company sold the new shares to 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 99 per cent of the group .
concerns regarding a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .

the US president and the First Lady Michelle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a Sta@@ ats d@@ iner tonight after the two leaders have bilateral discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ i &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i will give the opportunity to tackle divisions of dis@@ agreements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit initially announced in February , is expected to hit several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington , before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i will address a number of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns about alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola ham@@ pered 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern was just before the Com@@ mit@@ ment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion champion , four times champion league winners , twice champion champ@@ ions , twice champion champ@@ ions - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now betra@@ ys that he was already before the European Championship in 2008 before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t , &quot; he says .
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a supply of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to have a Romanian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi declares , why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he got me with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how the season 2008 / 2009 was running with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the royal class triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen scenario .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the filling of the film and not with the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with ins@@ ul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian joined .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to invite people to think about - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of the harmony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a groove that is beaten by her white band@@ age .
the producer of Dear White People was campaig@@ ning for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film direction ; Dam@@ on answered that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ ri@@ et and 4,000 Li@@ kes from its publication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved national action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured content .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gramm@@ y Awards .
&quot; album still matt , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ esses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport climb@@ s and operational assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition @-@ show , which completed her 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale they managed two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete to finish the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved or had more than 10,000 dollars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great degree of gra@@ ti@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .

Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ OL@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially fun for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
once upon a time they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers are in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all vic@@ tories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon er@@ ect his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two in@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year greatly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go completely concentrated into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit puzzle game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has swe@@ pt the heart@@ wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ger@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , clearly looked better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
at the end of the seventh in@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist Miguel S@@ ano , who tore a two @-@ run from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ hagen made the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League , that pl@@ ou@@ ted struck a double play
after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth interior , wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , reached S@@ ano in three pitches for his fifth save .
at the beginning of the game , Detroit benefited from a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three races in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than one month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , Hus@@ him delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Ball@@ eman .
a two @-@ out walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who managed a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos watched with a single on the right side , but managed to run another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers scored in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit particularly well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the S@@ hou@@ lder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder strain , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is stri@@ cken from the vulner@@ ability list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees should be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wedn@@ es@@ days .
the people in it are then to be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it comp@@ lied with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ ess@@ ische Landes@@ hauptstadt have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily get accommod@@ ated there .
they will then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in H@@ esse after the government pres@@ idency of the Gover@@ ning Board .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the resol@@ ute reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective dispos@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we were glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced checks on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no @-@ one will be sent back to Hungary .
also Germany sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , applied for a special summit for next week .
on Sunday , Germany had begun with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet reached a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday , 22 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong influ@@ x of refugees in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial recording and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people who need protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border with Serbia in the night on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be secured .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to promised Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to for the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to accounts of e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of immigrants report@@ edly went on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean swe@@ ars .
this includes researchers from observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
thus the moon stag@@ ger around the ring plane slightly on its path .
although this de@@ fle@@ ction movement is only small , yet too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) of Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the iron blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , which sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , closed the astronom@@ ers back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama l@@ acks several weeks in Munich
the 1860 Munich has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an examination of an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis is &quot; likely to break four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ald loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper looking at the possible obligation of a uni@@ form@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1960s , however , initially presented a def@@ ensive mann as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was under contract earlier also at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is expected to enter the running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured his head at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
however , contrary to his first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur@@ ring .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line will often be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
eating the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleas@@ antly smell .
the peel colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
however , a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ lets like Chi@@ cor@@ ea and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS represents up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
above all , drivers are sought .
already last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its rival , Fed@@ Ex , have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 delayed deliveries had made harsh criticism for the parcel services .
first F@@ öhn@@ le , then prominent cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Mete@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wedn@@ es@@ days and in the night on Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows at times with a storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ills .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings strong ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind @-@ bu@@ cks and a drop in temperature .
as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the alpine side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the fo@@ eh@@ ills until Thursday morning , isolated and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn winds its way to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains .
while in the north on wed@@ nes@@ days stor@@ my hair @-@ dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees provides , the humidity begins to sto@@ w at the alpine slope .
here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , this after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last days .
on Thursday morning the air escap@@ es , as a result , a cold front co@@ ols with powerful , partially weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the winds blow strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are present in the north , at 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees on the weekend .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday by the name of the German Re@@ former .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing had been requested by the community of evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , rec@@ alled on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in secret their faith in the city of pop@@ es for centuries .
the square symbol@@ ises that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he felt the city then as a fallen sin@@ ner be@@ ak .
his negative impressions , according to histori@@ ans , might have reinforced him in his later struggle against Rome .
then with his thes@@ es , Luther had introduced the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thor@@ ns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adjusted to the respective themes , this may seem quite d@@ ull .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or father@@ hood .
this makes him spontane@@ ously fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the Scrip@@ tures based on painting .
he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into present @-@ day contex@@ ts .
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Scrip@@ tural texts of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who puts his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up so that I may also bear my father &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help art again in the quick@@ est possible way : &quot; the perception of image worlds is now characterised by advertising , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different pleasure and bl@@ iss to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in the pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let them look and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I didn &apos;t care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , even mysterious themes for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15th at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail se@@ am
plans made , place found , company mand@@ ated , ground moun@@ ts mod@@ elled for a circuit : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail it was finished .
failure in politics and administration ensured a dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the railway .
so hill be@@ v@@ elled , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building license .
the approval was made in October , and the First Council of Community Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the Child and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional comm@@ em@@ oration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga will set a clear sign on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is interested in getting this topic under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to intensively discuss the situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chancell@@ ery next Wednesday and meet the Minister for State , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German soccer alliance has therefore expanded its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee initiative for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Nier@@ s@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal lists also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will carry the im@@ print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen @-@ President Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler der &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes to everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was talking about a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on this Friday , the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their own locations is great .
just as great is that small and smallest societies are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent is living in football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B election and the Federal Government will provide 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief executive of the company loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the US he fell to a water jar after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged himself out onto the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we met before the board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 year old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully labour @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , fully in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; Every@@ thing can happen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren re@@ plac@@ er Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ted a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he is therefore as little spare @-@ seek@@ er for the two Stam@@ mp@@ il@@ oten Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button in Singapore on the weekend as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B ( without Re@@ us vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate )
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us were finally defeated in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only alter its regular elf position on the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of the master b@@ art@@ ender Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European League matches in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left openly .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sch statement by fellow player Re@@ us , that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , is the medium @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; hence Marco does not lie that wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ bot cars : government wants leadership for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be a technological leader in the change of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the Motor Show I@@ AA of a &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together at the I@@ AA with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid access to digital radio .
to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make sure that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver .
when automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically feasible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles are to be expected on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate the value of the study by 2025 to around € 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must , however , be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical of their self @-@ prop@@ elled cars - much more than French or American .
a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the AA concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on it in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents expect car @-@ driven cars by 2025 , 33 percent in the US .
in Germany , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey conducted by the digital association Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire journey on all roads .
at least 15 percent could imagine that on the motorway , in traffic jams 45 percent could be imagined .
good every fourth person would leave the car under no circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the current status of the title fight between September 25 and October 4 , Düssel@@ dor@@ fer intends to open only in sing@@ les .
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term arranged sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German Champion will be back on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste to Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world rank@@ ings @-@ fifth explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has contra@@ cted a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ fying human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ached earlier , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his relu@@ ct@@ ant attitude to a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition ended a little after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canada &apos;s Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance , and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed total artwork for which much effort was done : to dev@@ ote the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers took 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leder@@ h@@ osen @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers alter Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to him .
he taught himself the ab@@ ject of fashion later on .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery in and around pl@@ ou@@ gh@@ ing to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es were created in large quantities for customers , which they worked on for example , to cover blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone is no longer functioning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of Pl@@ auen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ auen lace fashion plays a major role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewellery , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , borro@@ wed from past stit@@ ches , is an increasing job potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
Mo@@ zer@@ sko Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ auen lace and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they can carry the protected label .
over the last 15 years , about 80 percent of the turnover has been cut off .
private specialist shops and wholesale outlets are almost no longer available .
our products barely reach customers in this way .
nowadays the bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ly exported to Russia and the United States .
so enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points with respect to environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ der le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch office of the West@@ Saxon University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
some years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic Schne@@ eb@@ all@@ spitze .
the machine sti@@ ckers small spheres at some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith masters Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener head . &quot;
now she uses the tip of the snow@@ ball for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of Pl@@ auen lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and want to have a souven@@ ir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of Pl@@ auen lace .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to embar@@ k on a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
however , according to the &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it &apos;s not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magical children girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China border regions will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .

EU wants to double mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thereby considerably increase the consumption of consumers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has received a corresponding paper paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies will be passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain .
however , big pre@@ dat@@ or @-@ fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches must not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of cl@@ ause is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des de@@ fle@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal for humans , which is heavily enriched by the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inf@@ ants of the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the maximum values valid , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is primarily caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information by the German Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube has been &quot; permanently and nation@@ wide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
