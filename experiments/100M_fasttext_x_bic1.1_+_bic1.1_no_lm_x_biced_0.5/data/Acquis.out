&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of part I concerning preventive measures .
the purpose of the preventive measures laid down in this agreement is the timely identification of significant quantities of nuclear materials from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ ri@@ ors for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a degra@@ dation by the risk of early detection .
to en@@ rich the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as securing measure of basic importance , combined with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material not proven for a certain period is specified indicating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their checks , the Organization shall make full use of the security system of the Community after Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in applying their security measures , the Community shall make use of the procedures and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely determined and useful in the supple@@ mental agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of distant core material and inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measuring uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which for each material balance zone consisted of the core material and the changes in the inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) provisions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Ref@@ und to the Organisation in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures pursuant to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) will replace ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in the letter c ) has not yet been introduced into the States , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving nuclear material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circuit produced in the states , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this agreement .
a ) The preventive measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not met , the Community is , however , not possible or desired of resi@@ dues from resi@@ dues , so consult the organization and the community on the use of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The preventive measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention will be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , if the organization and the community establish that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material if it is used in gramm@@ es or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material which otherwise would be subject to security measures pursuant to this Convention , from these security measures , provided that the total amount of the core material delivered in the states is at no time any more than that .
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alle@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
( II ) Uran@@ ium , with enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with a enrich@@ ment , which is less than 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above which of Natur@@ ur@@ an , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ stroke square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with a enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed @-@ core material is to be processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the securing measures according to this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the community meets with the organization Com@@ ple@@ mentary agreements , which are necessary to determine how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable to the successful and effective fulfil@@ ment of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention .
the supple@@ mental agreements can be expanded or am@@ ended without amend@@ ment to this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement . the organization , the community and the states undertake all the efforts to make these agreements effective within 90 days of the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organization provides a summar@@ ized inventory of the entire core material underlying the safety measures of this agreement in the states , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory of inventory based on the following reports and the results of their reviews .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
( a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action plan laid down at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems .
C ) The objective of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the intermediate ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is clear in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ; this account is governed by the Organization as Administrator of Ac@@ ci@@ dent and is used only to the purpose specified in this Agreement , and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is seg@@ reg@@ ated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ sensitive deb@@ tors issued by the Member State , which at the request in the currency of the respective state must be paid in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited at the deposit point of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and indeed i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 CV . of the order within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remain@@ der of the report on 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every@@ one Member State may be able to make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the banknotes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the special transaction account appropriately .
when gran@@ ting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional lending capacity to loan conditions without exemp@@ tion ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each specific transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and swi@@ ft@@ ly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices adopted by the ordinary funds of the organization .
the funds of the special transaction cannot be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally considered for the organization granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years at a rate of ten free years .
they are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts to pay for this fee are directly to the organization that it reserves .
each transaction loan is defined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is given .
the recei@@ pts from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( ii ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction at the time of loan guarantee .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC concerning the purposes and programs approved by the directors to complete the issu@@ ance of all the Special Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ories .
during the time of the pay@@ out of the Special Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory Lo@@ an , the Administrator acqu@@ ires the E@@ WG quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
as soon as possible , the administrator transm@@ its a detailed account of the special transaction account as soon as possible after ending the financial year of the organization , with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this statement .
after full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the E@@ WG then transfers an extensive report on the projects financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the rep@@ ay@@ ments paid to the member states are evident .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Comm@@ unities ) and the Administrator to the full issue of the resources of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of programs or plans funded by special action figures and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the organization may agree , the agreements and all resulting obligations of the parties are due with immediate effect .
if the total amount of the special transaction loans taken by the recipi@@ ents in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement was rep@@ aid and returned to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties have been concluded with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governments of the member states are noti@@ fying the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Comm@@ unities addressing the procedure concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sec@@ retariat dra@@ fts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper authorisation of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the date of receipt of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch .

and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are transferred to a joint enterprise according to Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Joint Venture JET . &quot;
Switzerland has been concerned with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
due to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion to carry out extensive work , it is in the interests of the contract parties of the present agreement to sum up their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research work , which has reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement is intended to enable each contracting party to gain the largest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma hy@@ si@@ cs from the funds provided for the mutual research work , and therefore to achieve the common goal of these research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled fusion reaction .
to achieve the target of the present agreement , the Parties are associ@@ ating their respective research programs defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program will take over long @-@ term objectives and the forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or am@@ ended after inspection by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contracting parties accept a new program , this occurs in the place of the programs mentioned in App@@ endi@@ x I and II .
the Association provided in Par@@ agraph 1 shall be realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- replacement of personnel under the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , in Switzerland and in the third countries with whom Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated Third Parties , &quot; as well as the laboratories carried on the Eur@@ atom program ;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .

with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange that is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Human Rights . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the JET project , Switzerland is part of the applicable JET on the time of entry into force of the present agreement , whose pro@@ position it accepts .
furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become contractual partner of any contract , whose objective is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with the implementation of the Association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
the association agreement is particularly aimed at setting up a steering committee , including the competent representatives of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- monitoring and guiding the development of research work so that the best possible results are achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; V@@ G &quot; - represented .
the V@@ G , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is responsible for all research and development activities related to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s and establishes their T * strength in the interests of both parties in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common goal specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proc@@ ed@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the Advisory Group created as part of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the competent Swiss authorities are asked for it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agreements could be concluded by the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future prospects of the member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned below , for which the BI@@ Z would be ready .
with each Stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of long @-@ term hol@@ dings without having to exceed five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as in their subsequent extension , the BIS would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , the first draw would not be eff@@ ected before the end of a month after the completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available to the BIS at the end of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would take account of the bank &apos;s resources , presum@@ ably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who use the BIS at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely meet market rates .
however , if the BIS does not have to buy the necessary funds itself on the market , then the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Li@@ bor raised by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the approval of the Council of the European Comm@@ unities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ Z could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform me about the approval of the Council of the European Comm@@ unities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor to share with you the consent of the Council of the European Comm@@ unities to the content of this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on the trade with h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honour the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set the provisions on the import of lam@@ bs , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for She@@ ep and Go@@ at meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for cam@@ els , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina under@@ takes to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the form of supply is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protective cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that Argentina &apos;s imports exceed the agreed amounts in one year , the Community reserves the right to impose Argentina &apos;s imports for the remain@@ der of the year concerned .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products recorded by this agreement to a court sentence of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
with the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount set by the Argent@@ inian trade with every new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion is taken into account under the number 5 .
with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community , the total amount mentioned under number 2 is set to a community of 23@@ ,000 tonnes of slaughter .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the collective market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community makes provisions to prevent the sale of inter@@ vention@@ ist states of frozen meat due to the regulation of the regulation of the Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual use of funds or other promotion measures for the exp@@ ortation of sheep and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is carried out only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T , and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular by gran@@ ting a number of export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement to the products listed under the number 1 .
in its turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products origin@@ ates in Argentina from the submission of an export license , which is granted by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are defined in such a way that a deposit for the gran@@ ting of the import licence may be wai@@ ved for the products in question .
in implementing provisions , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community shall be informed in regular intervals by the quantities issued for the export lic@@ ences ; this information may be de@@ ferred to destination country where applicable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee will ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he regularly conduc@@ ts the tendency on the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of significance for the purposes referred to under Number 7 .
the Committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper application of this agreement is not imp@@ aired by the fact that articles from h@@ amm@@ el@@ - , lamb - and goat meat can be carried out under the agreement not mentioned collective bar@@ gaining numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee disc@@ usses all questions arising from the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without pre@@ ju@@ dice to the rights and obligations of the parties under the GAT@@ T .
the annual amount specified in number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 January .
the amount received from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual volume and takes account of the seasonal character of the trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand .
it is valid until March 31 , 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement are verified by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary to be necessary .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform your government about this .
I honor to confirm the receipt of your today &apos;s letter with the following wording :

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat
I honor to engage in the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set out provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for cam@@ els , lamb and goat meat .
recogni@@ zing the fact that the sheep industry and the export of cam@@ el and lamb after the world market and in particular after the community for the New Zealand economy is important and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement , New Zealand will ensure H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the Community market in the height specified in the agreement .

in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the quantity of the released year does not exceed the set amount .
the pre @-@ set quantities are carried out in the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community re@@ affir@@ ms that New Zealand does not intend to use this agreement to use new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the community market .
if a change in the form of supply is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contract parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in Kl@@ aus@@ el in order to find a suitable solution .
in the event that the community takes the protective cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed amounts , the Community reserves the right to export imports from this country .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products recorded by this agreement to a court sentence of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities set in cl@@ ause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion is taken into account in Kl@@ aus@@ el 5 .
with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community , the total amount mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 is set to a total of 245 500 tonnes of slaughter .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could affect the normal sales of New Zealand ar@@ mo@@ ury and lamb meat in the collective market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community makes provisions so that the sale of intervention states on frozen meat is not under@@ mining this objective due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of sheep in the community without risk of market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual use of funds or other subsi@@ dy measures for the exp@@ ortation of sheep and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is carried out only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities .
the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the above @-@ mentioned products origin@@ ates in New Zealand from the submission of an export license , which is granted by the competent authority designated by the New Zealand Government .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Uruguay on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb Me@@ at
I honour the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set the provisions on the import of lam@@ bs , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for She@@ ep and Go@@ at meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are classified as follows :
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ stelle 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ;
- Ch@@ illed slu@@ dge - , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ stelle 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay agre@@ es to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out according to the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the form of supply is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protective cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans &apos; access to the community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay exceeds the agreed amounts in one year , the Community reserves the right to exclude the imports from Uruguay for the remain@@ der of the year concerned .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products recorded by this agreement to a court of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the case of accession of new Member States , the Community in Consult@@ ation with Uruguay alters the amount specified under number 2 according to the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States are set in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion is taken into account under the number 5 .
with the passage of Greece &apos;s accession to the community , the total amount mentioned under number 2 is set to the community at 5 800 tonnes of slaughter .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the collective market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of inter@@ vention@@ ist states in frozen meat does not under@@ mine the passage of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ otic sheep on the basis of the regulation of the regulation of Urugu@@ ay@@ an sheep .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agre@@ es that any actual use of funds or other promotion measures for the exp@@ ortation of sheep and lamb , as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is carried out only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T , and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by gran@@ ting export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement to the products listed under the number 1 .
the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the above @-@ mentioned products origin@@ ates from the submission of an export license , issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in terms of implementing regulations , the responsible ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ische municipality of the competent authority of the Community shall be informed in regular intervals by the quantities issued for the export lic@@ ences ; this information may be de@@ cryp@@ ted to destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until March 31 , 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a deadline of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement are verified by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .

a reag@@ ent for blood type determination must react with all the blood samples tested , containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly di@@ lu@@ tion of the reag@@ ent to be analyzed on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum fer@@ til@@ isation in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lu@@ tion is calculated exclusively in the volume of the blood cell in@@ undation in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents that are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for the determination of the blood type determination of international standards , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being worked out .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for the determination of blood @-@ group determination of most specific@@ ities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flood .
the ti@@ ter releases the di@@ lu@@ tion of the reag@@ ent in the last mix within a series where a microsc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood type determination , for the International Standard Prepar@@ ations ( at the time of anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and in@@ exhaus@@ tive anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tration of the unknown reag@@ ent in international units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a compar@@ ative title of the International Standard Program Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A reag@@ ent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent in a fluid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the ex@@ piration date for dry reag@@ ents on the label depends on the results of the fe@@ asi@@ bility studies ; it is appro@@ v@@ ed@@ by the state supervisory authorities .
dry reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry reag@@ ent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ orous pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry reag@@ ents ) can be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , as long as the reag@@ ent and the added substance continue to satisfy the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
reag@@ ents , regardless of whether in a fluid form or after re@@ plen@@ ishment , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the reag@@ ents needed for international exchange for the determination of blood @-@ group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international convention comes into being through a unified system .
reag@@ ents for blood type determination are distributed in such a way and in such quantities , that the reag@@ ent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that if necessary , the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of reag@@ ents for the determination of blood type determination .
appropriate samples of all given reag@@ ents are to be stored for so long from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
reag@@ ents used for the determination of blood type can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective portion ; the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each single tank , a black printed label can be attached in English and French , containing the following information : first name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in the case of dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
furthermore , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following details : 1 . full Name and Ad@@ dress of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , in the case of dried reag@@ ents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
each con@@ sign@@ ment must be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with the arrangement of this protocol .
