<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States, Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">(a) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action plan laid down at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The objective of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound up within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the intermediate ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is clear in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Account" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement; this account is governed by the Organization as Administrator of Accident and is used only to the purpose specified in this Agreement, and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is segregated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or insensitive debtors issued by the Member State, which at the request in the currency of the respective state must be paid in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit point of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Everyone Member State may be able to make payments before the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedure of the organization, the caretaker takes about proportionate drawing on the cash or the banknotes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the special transaction account appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) of the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its additional lending capacity to loan conditions without exemption; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each specific transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and swiftly payable development program or project (including a sectoral project), irrespective of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices adopted by the ordinary funds of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction cannot be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project, which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the day of entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transactions are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally considered for the organization granted by the organization; they are therefore refundable in 50 years at a rate of ten free years.</seg>

<seg id="749">Amounts to pay for this fee are directly to the organization that it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is defined by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in particular the origin of the funds is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The receipts from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services (ii) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction at the time of loan guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a Member State shall be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches the EEC concerning the purposes and programs approved by the directors to complete the issuance of all the Special Repositories.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the payout of the Special Repository Loan, the Administrator acquires the EWG quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the administrator transmits a detailed account of the special transaction account as soon as possible after ending the financial year of the organization, with a statement from the external auditor of the organization to this statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loans, the administrator of the EWG then transfers an extensive report on the projects financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the repayments paid to the member states are evident.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the Administrator to the full issue of the resources of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction, the progress of programs or plans funded by special action figures and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>

<seg id="851">The agreements could be concluded by the total amount paid by the creditor to the mechanism paid by the creditor, within a total limit of 2.725 billion units; this corresponds to 50% of all future prospects of the member countries.</seg>
<seg id="852">However, some conditions are already mentioned below, for which the BIZ would be ready.</seg>
<seg id="853">With each Standby credit, the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years, with the possibility of long-term holdings without having to exceed five years.</seg>
<seg id="854">At the opening of the loans, as well as in their subsequent extension, the BIS would charge a credit-opening commission.</seg>
<seg id="855">In addition, the first draw would not be effected before the end of a month after the completion of the Standby Agreement, so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity.</seg>
<seg id="856">The drawing would take place in the currencies available to the BIS at the end of the agreement, very likely in US dollars; they would extend to periods that would take account of the bank's resources, presumably three or six months.</seg>
<seg id="857">The conditions would correspond to those who use the BIS at the time under similar conditions, i.e. interest rates would largely meet market rates.</seg>

<seg id="1130">As part of this agreement, the export possibilities for camels, lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount: 20 000 tons, expressed in carcass weight (1).</seg>
<seg id="1131">In order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement, Argentina undertakes to ensure that the quantity of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to the traditional offer forms (frozen or cooled).</seg>
<seg id="1132">If a change in the form of supply is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade, the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 to find an appropriate solution.</seg>
