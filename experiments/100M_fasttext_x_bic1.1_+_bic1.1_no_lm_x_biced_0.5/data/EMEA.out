this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. in@@ gen@@ ious thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psychological condition in which the patients have man@@ ic epis@@ odes ( periods of abnormal elation ) alter@@ nating with periods of normal mood .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes and to prevent man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ing or the fusion tablets in patients who difficulties swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , the dose of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol works like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to prevent the recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three trials up to a year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients who had already been stabil@@ ised with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared with that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined patients &apos; symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients addressing the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75@@ mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ term studies as plac@@ ebo .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes of previously treated patients up to 74 weeks compared to plac@@ ebo and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y to intake ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ch@@ oking ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nausea ) , fatigue and fatigue ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes , and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes matched the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with a man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ s across the European Union .
A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar confusion and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mainly had man@@ ic epis@@ odes and associated their man@@ ic epis@@ odes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages with a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ ion disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
in consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after beginning or after an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esien : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia when treated with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dism@@ issed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with aria pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with over@@ l@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.8 ) .
the H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the c@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions .
in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data exposure to safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk of fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole included a lower incidence of EPS including Parkinson &apos;s , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to those treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under@@ went ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with reli@@ ef@@ ul@@ in therapy .
some epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23,@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under@@ gone Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
the enhancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) are among the side effects reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in clinical studies and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
there is no information on the effectiveness of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose is of benefit since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receiver and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receiver lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ amen .
in three plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medi@@ ation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a superior effect compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a plac@@ ebo @-@ superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features which in some cases did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement period for 74 weeks with man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to plac@@ ebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for dehy@@ dra@@ tion and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , which cataly@@ zes N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .

in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
there was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with varied liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so that they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bil@@ e of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the Sul@@ fate Con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg , were no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bil@@ e of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .

A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ itation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in people with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with a man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine already used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if an oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is indicated , see summary of the characteristics of the medicine to acquire A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol &apos;s injection solution in patients with det@@ ri@@ mental and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution as necessary , patients should be observed in regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( dehy@@ dra@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding a deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
however , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared with that after all@@ usion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( 15 mg dose ) were administered intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ BI@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that after all@@ usion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under@@ went ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium therapy .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
the enhancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) are among the side effects reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvement of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction compared with plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms in relation to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medi@@ ation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression @-@ rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of the decl@@ ining rate was found for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significant fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features which in some cases did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to plac@@ ebo in view of the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is 90 % greater than AU@@ C after the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application showed no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which lay in 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in ra@@ bb@@ its these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , three quarters of which had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration and as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of the efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing disease and survival .
in contrast to these indicators , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in addition , it must not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted to the company Abra@@ x@@ ane Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in case of sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy 3 the treatment is interrupted until an improvement is reached on Grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were carried out with patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose modifications in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have considerably other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no further abra@@ x@@ ane cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient &apos;s collective are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating remedies .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contra@@ cep@@ tive method during and up to one month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
in the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , male patients should be advised to have an irre@@ versi@@ bly in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( common ) that can affect the transport capability and the ability to operate machines .
the most common and most important cases of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer were listed in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the amal@@ gam@@ ation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular @-@ indi@@ ms and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ y@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in induc@@ es the transport of alb@@ um@@ in through end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is convey@@ ed through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ rec@@ zep@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour is presented due to the alb@@ um@@ bili@@ zing protein SP@@ ARC ( leu@@ ko@@ dic protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of m@@ BC for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arms and 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III compar@@ ative study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was administered in the form of an inf@@ usion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an inf@@ usion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el therapy every 3 weeks , either in form of sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 . the results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for a period of time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound of bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials .
exposure to active substance ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 . after intraven@@ ous treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the medium distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or binding closure of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane donation ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue hist@@ opath@@ ies it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is first and foremost met@@ aboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion of the unchanged active ingredient was less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
more than 75 years of age , however , only a few data are available , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market before market launch provides healthcare professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
• Educational bro@@ sch@@ ure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging . • With clear visual representation of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport by the patient .
this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications can occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml can be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his super@@ visor as long as they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
all patients &apos; iron values must be monitored before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
when administered , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a v@@ ein as part of a primary study involving 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of eff@@ lu@@ te eff@@ ected under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ ra@@ ine headache and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
secre@@ tion as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to make sure there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that , according to the provisions of the European Union , it has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which produces ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .

an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values above or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration can occasionally be observed in a patient .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

alternatively , the injection can be given via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula to the end of di@@ aly@@ sis , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) in the treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ) .

in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the car@@ c@@ ass or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very seldom has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a failure to address ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ ous toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are studied .
if the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) is low ( i.e. the Re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason for an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in section 4.2 .
in clinical trials an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the use of epo@@ e@@ ines if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the an@@ emia and the prevention of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should amount to about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evidence @-@ resistant cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentrations in section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in case of tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be considered for ass@@ essing the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ coded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , the cause of an@@ emia should be examined before the start of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular disease , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa can lead to an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events when treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dosage should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ emor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically engineered epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has gly@@ co@@ sides and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydrates with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which has been isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated with an@@ emia due to various pre@@ valent mal@@ ign@@ omas persistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treated patients and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ian events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy to achieve a ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the tested data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa rules after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved following IV injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .

the holder of approval for placing on the market has to make sure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. has been set up and functional before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the drug is used in the traffic .
the owner of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) , listed in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance , is committed to carrying out the Risk Management Plans ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the application application , as well as the update of the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ del@@ ine on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SUR ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • When receiving new information that could affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days after reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction )
• Have a heart attack or stroke in a month before your treatment - if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first occurring or reinforced chest pain ) • the risk of a blood gra@@ ft formation in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) exists - if , for example , such a blood c@@ lot has occurred .

during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the amount of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is reflected in further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , conduct regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , the dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before beginning of therapy .
very rarely , ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , secre@@ tion must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value may pose the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or elevated levels of potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your levels of red blood pig@@ ment ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your depos@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of a cereb@@ ro@@ spinal fluid ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully over the benefits derived from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have already occurred in the past ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you are cancer patients , remember that stre@@ amed amed like a growth factor for blood cells and in certain circumstances may affect the tumor adver@@ sely .
if you are about to undergo a major orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood pig@@ ment ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get aber@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( remedies for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia respon@@ ds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of aber@@ rated between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large injec@@ tions .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to make sure that the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before the surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before the surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones fragile ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures such as the h@@ inf@@ all ; • Disease Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first inf@@ usion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ asta inhi@@ bits the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
to treat the disease of Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ asta is only prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ asta .
in the first study , nearly 8,@@ 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ aw was tested in two studies to a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) returned to normal levels in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in people under A@@ cl@@ aw ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo .
compared to all patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those taking plac@@ ebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hip fra@@ cture 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ aw had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients taking plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cl@@ asta adverse events occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients , A@@ cl@@ asta inhi@@ bits the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
A@@ cl@@ asta &quot; s manufacturer provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material to patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing of A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis - in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic fem@@ oral fra@@ cture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic fem@@ oral frac@@ tures , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ aw is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip fra@@ cture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ aw should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ aw , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ asta inf@@ usion .
the frequency of symptoms experienced within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ aw can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) In Pati@@ ents with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of elderly patients is similar to younger patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ cl@@ asta &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not recommended for children and young people under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ cl@@ aw is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population .
before the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta , pre @-@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ emia is to be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid deployment of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs normally within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , respectively , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
cancer ( chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ onate to a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
there is no data available for patients who need dental interventions , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate decreases the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms experienced within the first three days after A@@ cl@@ aw can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of fibr@@ ill@@ ation reported as serious side effects was increased in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ aw ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid was associated with ren@@ al dysfunction ( i.e. an increase of the serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing ( measured annually before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis more than three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine in 10 days after application was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ aw compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic levels of calcium found below the normal range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ aw in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered fra@@ cture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ och@@ ro@@ sen in the jaw area was reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after dental extra@@ ctions or other dental interventions .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area in one with A@@ cl@@ asta and plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients .
in the event of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be compens@@ ated .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ aw 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 65 @-@ 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral cavity at ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ tures .
effects on spinal frac@@ tures of A@@ cl@@ aw decreased significantly over a period of three years , as well as the frequency of one or more new bone frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ aw @-@ treated patients 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ aw increased bone density in lum@@ bar verteb@@ ral acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh@@ th by 5.1 % , and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic slu@@ dge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared with plac@@ ebo and the receipt of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ asta decreased significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared with bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to inf@@ usion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ aw , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , A@@ cl@@ aw treated the BM@@ D at all times in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment .
A@@ cl@@ aw treatment resulted in more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , increasing the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the total head and by 4.3 % at the lower leg .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ Ol@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta compared to the once weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was not subject to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in A@@ cl@@ aw Disease Pa@@ get was examined in patients and patients over 30 years of age with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moderate mor@@ bus passport of the bone ( mean serum levels of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 m@@ g. of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was proven in two six months comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared with bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta and 107 with Ris@@ on@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ on@@ ron@@ at , during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ off and multi@@ ples 5 and 15 minutes permanent inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large circulation with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a prolonged elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , whereas the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total Body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of met@@ aboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ aboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , drug @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of cre@@ atine clearance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in an easy ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ atine clearance up to 35 ml / min . no dose adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid required .
because there are only limited data for severe kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ sequ@@ ential intraven@@ ous one dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6 times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ jun@@ ctive and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid was administered in rats by dose of 0.6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well toler@@ ated .
long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure were toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , an attack that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
in ra@@ bb@@ its no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum levels of serum .

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and women &apos;s Disease Pa@@ get .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is structured uni@@ form@@ ly , which makes bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta inhi@@ bits bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus reg@@ aining strength .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
when applying A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines which are known to harm the kid@@ neys .
when applying A@@ cl@@ asta along with food and drink , you should be concerned that , according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , sufficient fluid can be taken before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cl@@ aw two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip .
the usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an inf@@ usion into a v@@ ein .
as A@@ cl@@ aw works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ aw can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before termin@@ ating treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta If you consider the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta , please take your next appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) but are less common after inf@@ usions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
at present it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ asta is causing this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get A@@ cl@@ asta .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate for other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , n@@ ettle rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling of the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the above @-@ mentioned side effects will significantly adver@@ sely affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this manual information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , it is recommended to follow the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ aw two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip fra@@ cture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients need to be adequately supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid deployment of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs normally within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .

A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients • suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond , or several I
in addition , four studies were carried out to over 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a supporting agent for setting the smoking area compared to a plac@@ ebo .
on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking did not show any uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during trials ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable when using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use with HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or clari@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used and anti@@ de@@ press@@ ant disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
even in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have any disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other close relatives are advised that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant during the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) in less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it can additionally be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos has led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of Ac@@ tos &apos; additional donation to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ f@@ ony@@ l res@@ ins showed a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional donation of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who also took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high k@@ et@@ one mirror - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for placing Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the in@@ scription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) to develop a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms which point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dark urine , liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are passed .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) appeared below the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ p@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and reduced levels of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral double or triple combination therapy with sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or as two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
following the introduction of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with reduced visual acu@@ ity was reported .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated incidence of Fra@@ ktur was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wants pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment must be stopped ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are met@@ aboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the reduction in hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal while reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed also with other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege performed more than three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ um@@ ed .
since its market launch , it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more frequently if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study spann@@ ing over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days , no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to function via activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated rec@@ ep@@ tor γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and improves peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as a mon@@ otherapy was carried out over two years to investigate the time up to the treatment of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was sufficiently adjusted with insulin for three months was random@@ ized to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to initial values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ etics .
in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol was observed as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ ob@@ azi@@ de and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while values reduced under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ ob@@ azi@@ de were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing progressive mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups , who received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral use , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the highest concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma normally 2 hours after application .
on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to efficacy corresponds to the triple the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
studies have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after or@@ ally use of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys comp@@ lied with repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the reduction in hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ a@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal while reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epithel@@ ium was induced in the rat .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ cons led to increased frequency of col@@ ont@@ al tum@@ ours .

the calculated incidence of Fra@@ ktur was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or gli@@ de @-@ azi@@ de .
in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , both with an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ ard synthesis .
although the study was lacking in terms of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stro@@ kes , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was administered to a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lowered much like another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
you may also need to adjust the doses of acet@@ one if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of the package ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weigh@@ ed to the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the import of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice daily if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer sustained effect .
the injec@@ tions needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA versus insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
prior to trips involving several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account potential interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medications taken by them .
4 . hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in an un@@ controlled diabetes therapy increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent brain functioning and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints related to acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in the blood sugar level can , however , be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ etics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help sper@@ son or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is achieved within 2 to 8 hours and the total length of the active life is up to 24 hours .
absorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of acet@@ pi@@ d may also be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the launch of Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin can be raised first , then the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
prior to trips involving several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

this can happen : • If you are injec@@ ting too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal , if you eat more than otherwise physically .
always set the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let manufacturing p@@ ens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Rem@@ ove the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Do always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • P@@ ut the large outer cap of the injection needle and the internal lid of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep ac@@ tra@@ pi@@ d Nov@@ o@@ Let upwards with the injection needle post • Klo@@ pping a few times with the finger against the cartridge .
when bub@@ bles are present , they will accum@@ ulate above in the cartridge • Dur@@ ing the injection needle continues upward , rotate the cartridge around a click in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Dur@@ ing the injection needle continues upward ( figure C ) • Now , a drop of insulin has to be extracted from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the closing cap again on the finished pen , that the digit 0 stands opposite the met@@ ering brand ( Figure D ) • Control whether the press button is pressed completely .
if the pressure button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed from the injection needle . the scale on the closing cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves outside while you rotate the closing cap • The scale under the press button ( press button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Not@@ ch the highest number you can see on the press button • add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap just forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push button is at the bottom and you can feel a resistance , then take off the cap and put it in such a way that the 0 of the met@@ ering brand is opposite .
make sure to press the pressure knob only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the pressure knob down immediately after injection , until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
it may not be accurate • You cannot set a dose that is higher than the number of remaining units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is still remaining , but you cannot use it to adjust or select your dose .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atic bur@@ r ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ mor@@ dial cryst@@ all@@ ations which may result in joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg per day .
in the first months of treatment , rheum@@ atism can still occur ; this is why it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic have other medicines to prevent rheum@@ atism .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine used to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two dos@@ ages of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year at 7@@ 62 patients .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid level in the blood was below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients who received 80 mg at a dose of once daily and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once a day , at the last three measurements showed a level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under@@ took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular , patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ me@@ val deposits ( including one of the medical history known or currently present bur@@ sting no@@ des and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum for 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose increase can be taken into consideration for A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Because there are no experiences with children and young people , the application of F@@ eb@@ i@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .

cardiovascular disease If patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ i@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
as with other herbal medicines , it is possible to treat acute rheum@@ atism during the course of treatment because of the reduction of the serum har@@ n@@ essing brick , ur@@ inary acid deposits can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .

liver disease Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ i@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the F@@ eb@@ i@@ ux@@ o@@ state treatment and , depending on the clinical findings , a liver function test ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line has no interaction studies carried out on F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O escap@@ ement can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ i@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( c@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ i@@ ost@@ at or the other active substance required at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC showed a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ing effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids Es could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and causes a decrease of the c@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be close to side effects of the fo@@ ve@@ er ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .

patients should be careful in controlling a vehicle , operating machines or when exercising dangerous activities , until they can be reasonably sure that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the whole f@@ eb@@ u@@ ine group compared to the allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ eb@@ i@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are being treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin impacts or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 906 patients were treated for up to one year , 3@@ 22 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients for up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ i@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ o@@ sta treatment groups and occurred in patients receiving F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ v@@ ot studies phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ not@@ thes@@ ia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short breathing , prot@@ ru@@ sion , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in the concentration of potassium in the blood , decrease in the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and occurs as part of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ i@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ in selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
the efficacy of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ v@@ ot studies in Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum content of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditionally used doses allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the serum har@@ ness level &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um C@@ ret@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1,5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D ) .
with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage decline of the serum levels in the test subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function distur@@ ban@@ ces ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl , 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ res@@ um@@ per@@ ic acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum har@@ n@@ ness levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 35@@ 7 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a rheum@@ atic boost in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not need treatment for a rheum@@ atic boost ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the density of the plaster no@@ des , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the bur@@ sting no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ s / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( c@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentrations time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ i@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the c@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage reduction in serum levels of serum ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state @-@ Distribution Volume ( V@@ pp / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ i@@ o@@ sta glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in urine as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
aside from the ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the stool as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the c@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ of ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ of ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

there were no significant changes in the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary tum@@ ors ( transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , in approximately the 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and pri@@ me@@ val composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it has been found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , lin@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied by lowering of the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and with carrying ra@@ bb@@ its with ex@@ positions , which were approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not give any ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 can be used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE equ@@ als exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive tract such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , ab@@ dom@@ es ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as sour upset .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it must not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot sit or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2007 the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. a permit for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following information is to be strictly observed to reduce the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ c@@ ers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ero@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely reported by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required hospit@@ alization ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of any mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out when symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn smoking the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of serious side @-@ ha@@ i@@ thal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that indicate a mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk was found , rare ( after market launch ) of stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) .
oste@@ opathy of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose treatment regime has predominantly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available which indicate whether the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis therapy in patients who require a max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial surgery .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the intended day of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at once they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at do not indicate directly harmful effects in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum @-@ calcium intake up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum levels of phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at In@@ ference of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light on the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ gen to vitamin D3 .

in this study , the daily application of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal correction by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % vs. Pla@@ z@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Be@@ aded on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ings and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability increased correspon@@ d@@ ingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % , when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day for five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies have shown that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous injection of 1 mg / kg but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion According to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the wood .
after intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance was not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted in rats using the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by humans is influenced by these transport systems .
res@@ or@@ ption in healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) was after the gift of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ings and two hours before taking a meal the middle surface under serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng / h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D3 level ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( c@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and medi@@ an time up to the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
biot@@ in formation vitamin D3 is rapidly met@@ aboli@@ zed to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 in the liver and then met@@ aboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
in the case of a radi@@ cally marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 48 hours , in the subjects after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the share of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although there is no clinical data about it , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bone is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on safety p@@ its , chronic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

advoc@@ acy is administered adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent the transplan@@ ted organ rejection by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , exam@@ ining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or re @-@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , more than 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were conducted and examined how Adv@@ ant@@ age is absorbed by the body compared to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ft .
trem@@ ors , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other components , advoc@@ ate may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful when other medicines ( especially some herbal ) are taken at the same time by Adv@@ ant@@ an@@ f , as the an@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ated yellow @-@ orange gel capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule shell with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule with &quot; N@@ 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; reform@@ ulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narrow @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is maintained .
the dosage of Adv@@ ant@@ ages should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood mir@@ r@@ oring ( see &quot; Recommen@@ dations below &quot; ) .
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ant@@ age to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the lawyer &apos;s scheme can take several days until Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral use of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney Transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ant@@ ation Therap@@ y should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - Li@@ ver Transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ant@@ ation Therap@@ y should begin at 0,@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily application in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ ages M@@ ust a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dose of Progra@@ f capsules to be converted into a daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ ages , this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ant@@ an@@ dia once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ als recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation must start for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ tation In adults who are switched to Adv@@ ant@@ ages , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipi@@ ents , although there is no clinical experience with lawyers in lung , pancre@@ as and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ted patients , received Progra@@ f in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0,2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted range can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions .
patients with ren@@ al function since ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ in and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ant@@ age When converting a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in a single case with the aid of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ke controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to an@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ ancing is a medicinal product with low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; reform@@ ulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narrow @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 To treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have been treated as therapy agents to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is no clinical data available for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ ant@@ ages .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recei@@ vers and gra@@ ft recei@@ vers in childhood there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ ant@@ ages .
because of possible interactions , which may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with lawyers ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is provided , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , it was possible to observe a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy called cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which may therefore occur under Adv@@ ant@@ an@@ ate .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart diseases , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ant@@ ations contain hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ent , lac@@ tose , special caution is recommended in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while taking substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
strong interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and vor@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ aboli@@ zed with medicines which are met@@ aboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions about contrac@@ eption are particularly careful .
the results of animal studies have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life time .

in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients suffering from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus often increase suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ ale ) .
cases of BK @-@ virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with lawyers .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours related to treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ tic .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent isolation of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ ins ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ -@@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patients transplan@@ ted , in 4@@ 75 patients who had under@@ gone a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall the safety profile of oral programm@@ f in these published studies ac@@ counted for the observations in the large studies where Progra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ enter study with oral Progra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome was less common after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came to 21.@@ 7 % of the cases of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8,0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly higher ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients being converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ center study with oral Progra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who received a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t , which were random@@ ised to receive tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ als dose of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the target range from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tations revealed an acute survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ine , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 multi @-@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ tations ) .

factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metabol@@ ised prior to ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly done through the bil@@ e .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) in advoc@@ acy ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was nearly 10 % lower than in Progra@@ f , for stable patients who have been converted from Progra@@ f ( twice a day ) to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is still no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Adv@@ ant@@ ages .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart diseases , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % in the first 24 weeks in the lawyer group ( N = 237 ) 32.@@ 6 % and in the Progra@@ f group ( N = 234 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

adv@@ ent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application determine whether Adv@@ ances for the treatment of bleeding or preventing ha@@ emor@@ rh@@ ages are applied in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
adv@@ ent is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain any protein or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new bleeding complications was assessed as &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of lawyers ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII .
adv@@ ent may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG authorization for the placing of lawyers across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following ha@@ emor@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions .
individual patients may differ in response to Factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and show different half @-@ life times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be dos@@ ages between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the en@@ rol@@ ment rate is to be directed following the patient &apos;s finding , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of Factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 re@@ positioning days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ sus known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ ggers ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there is no experience in the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the number of patients appearing in the largest number of patients was inhibit@@ ors against Factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of whom had previously untreated patients who had a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . b ) The unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII @-@ levels occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ OC inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ OC to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VIII concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or was observed in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VIII concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ OC treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against Factor VIII .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated protein was analysed by exam@@ ining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but no signs or symptoms observed , indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ OC has been reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the Factor VIII activ@@ ates as a factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor x from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ OC were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic value of factor VIII activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study using A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients at the same time or &gt; 10 years and are listed in the below table 3 .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to assess the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the security profile of A@@ DV@@ OC , which necess@@ it@@ ates a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal measures in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited approved the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its application for approval for the placing of the adv@@ ex@@ in on the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissue that connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) is affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies produced by themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and the killing of the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and cancer cells can grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer occurred in the area of under@@ mining , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP tested the answers of the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still un@@ answered .
based on the review of the original documents submitted , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions that will be sent to the company by day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed mode of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective constitu@@ ents will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever caused by an allergy to P@@ ollen from nas@@ al paths ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and you@@ ths from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main factors were the changes in sever@@ ity of the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a 37.@@ 4 % relief compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients against adren@@ ergi@@ c active ingredients or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine used to treat allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ emor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or ha@@ emor@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swal@@ low as a whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing it apart , to cr@@ ush or ch@@ ew ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children less than 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks following such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ id , l@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a that are per@@ oral or nas@@ al as devi@@ ant rhin@@ ologi@@ ch@@ um ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that treatment with hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea , or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be dism@@ issed .
• Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck instructions , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be stopped at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines have otherwise been able to prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , no matter if des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ fulness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , did not raise the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ ting properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impair@@ ment of transport capability or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en and the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , the L@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance , including rein@@ forcement of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , there was no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess than plac@@ ebo recommended in the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , where 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except mu@@ c@@ ous mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after the administration is administered .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi dose study , which was performed using the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test subjects were poor@@ ly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( c@@ max and AU@@ C ) from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine following the sole dose of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equi@@ val@@ ents was for exposure according to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ine / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on ra@@ bb@@ its in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines help relieve the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , and its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) .
effectiveness has been measured by determining the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , affecting the sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the syrup , the solution to intake and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is safe .
in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ER@@ I@@ US showed an average decrease of the symptom ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the two trials at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six weeks with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2001 the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may end after the symptom sever@@ ity and can be res@@ um@@ ed during their re@@ occurrence .
in the per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuing treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , alcohol is not ampli@@ fied while taking A@@ ER@@ I@@ US and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impair@@ ment of transport capability or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients aged 12 to 17 , the most frequent side effect was headache , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en and the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhes@@ ion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses given up to 20 m@@ g. a day in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , the L@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance , including rein@@ forcement of subjective dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis can be classified as an alternative also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total quality of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the eti@@ ology of the different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ amine infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine will also lead to an improvement of the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines from the study was excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US significantly reduced the disorder of sleep and wak@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients @-@ demo@@ ographi@@ es were comparable with the general seasonal allergic Rhin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of the patients .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ ER@@ I@@ US can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious Rhin@@ itis with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience higher sub@@ stan@@ tive load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ aboli@@ zing , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normal .
this medicine contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , simultaneous intake of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US syrup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents diagnosed with up to 45 mg of deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received an average daily dose of 1.@@ 25@@ mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) .
since the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents in which deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or therapy in adults and adolescents in clinical studies .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a reduction of alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance nor an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total live of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets reduce effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are fully met@@ aboli@@ zing .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the c@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient @-@ cum@@ ulation following a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , CLE@@ LC and c@@ max levels of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US syrup is available in type III brown glass bottles with child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to take once daily in the mouth , relieve the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and per@@ si@@ sting allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of deser@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated to intake ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 m@@ g. a day in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .

the efficacy and safety of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine syrup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melting tablet was used as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for engaging in des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .

the prolifer@@ ation of this badly @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) greater than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( adult 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose Cros@@ sover studies of A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melting tray with A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for intake were the formulation bi@@ equivalent .
A@@ ER@@ I@@ US 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ ER@@ I@@ US melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully met@@ aboli@@ zing , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normal .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months were the most common side effects reported more often than plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was observed . no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years of age .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see paragraph 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rhin@@ itis may depend on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and
as demonstrated by the total quality of the questionn@@ aire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ ER@@ I@@ US tablets reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the spread of this limited @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ ER@@ I@@ US solution contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no organic equi@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the syrup and tablets .

driving ti@@ ghtness and operating machines If used in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that A@@ ER@@ I@@ US will lead to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduce attention .
if you have been told by your doctor that you have an intoler@@ ance against certain sugar@@ s , consult your doctor before taking this medicine .
regarding the duration of treatment , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rhin@@ itis under which you suffer and will then determine how long you should take A@@ ER@@ I@@ US .
if your allergic rhin@@ itis is inter@@ mitt@@ ent ( the symptoms usually occur less than 4 days a week or lasts less than 4 weeks ) , your doctor will recommend you a treatment scheme that depends on your previous disease progression .
if your allergic rhin@@ itis is per@@ si@@ sting ( the symptoms occur in 4 or more days a week and lasts more than 4 weeks ) , your doctor may recommend you a longer lasting treatment .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced that the company decl@@ ines its application for approval for the placing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a specific type of vaccine , which should protect from a strain of the influ@@ enza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the influ@@ enza virus appears , which can easily be spread by humans , because human beings do not yet have a immun@@ ity ( no protection ) .
by administ@@ ering the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influ@@ enza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and makes antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system can later form a fast antibody in contact with a flu virus of this common strain .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus was separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a body foreign ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ ode@@ fici@@ ency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination is not investigated .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has been judged that the virus will respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ cri@@ be is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , the A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , excluding Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r medicinal product A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ e@@ ase inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , more patients under@@ went viral load less than 400 copies / m@@ L in 48 weeks compared to plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicinal product A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load of the viral load decreased after four weeks compared with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines which are min@@ ed in the same way as as@@ cri@@ be and are det@@ ri@@ mental to high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines against HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were predomin@@ ant over the course of four years .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic pre@@ amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of as@@ su@@ re@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generic ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; given limited information at the time of approval for scientific purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the placing of as@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic p@@ adding of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of as@@ re@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
generic ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude and are also represented by sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r during ing@@ es@@ tion of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ re@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver dysfunction with potentially fatal course .
for the case of an anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin depends strongly on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who are taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ cep@@ tives may be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for om@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl @-@ gly@@ co@@ gen content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be cancelled in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases associated with the treatment of medicines which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune deficiency , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initi@@ ation of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic latitude must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude and are also represented by sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic beam A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with elevated plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the low plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors combined with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already engaged in St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ ab@@ avi@@ rus levels are and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
508 % increases , for c@@ max against it by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % is hum@@ bled when amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the con@@ current administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to watch closely because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the ant@@ acids component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants would lower .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may lo@@ wers the serum concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be undertaken as a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous application of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus a rise in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if clinical reasons are required to administ@@ er Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trials with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of con@@ current administration .
simultaneous use of two times daily 700 m@@ g. of F@@ ossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200@@ mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the c@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma around 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 ) compared to the value observed after 200@@ mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions together with as@@ su@@ re@@ ase .
the patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs when applied in combination with as@@ su@@ re@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ su@@ re@@ ase since it can lead to absorption problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as an enzyme sector ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including li@@ very li@@ very , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous application of generic ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase the plasma levels of plasma levels while administ@@ ering a@@ generic ase .
since plasma pi@@ cks of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , since the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while using amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ su@@ re@@ ase cannot be applied together with Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , which is recommended with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am while using A@@ gener@@ ase .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for om@@ pi@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at this time , just as the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosage is to be adjusted if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contra@@ cep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may be applied only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r enters into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the dis@@ arm@@ ament in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy .
further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most adverse events associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the treatment of treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of drugs or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of underlying disease .
most of the above @-@ mentioned side effects stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ ation and performed at more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and facial sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation .
113 anti @-@ retro@@ viral individuals who had been treated with am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ din over a mean duration of 36 weeks was only one case ( bull &apos;s ja@@ ws ) ( &lt; 1 % ) observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients under amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients with ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ rous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r had to be ab@@ orted .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis are reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed with all@@ usion of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were very common in patients who received au@@ re@@ ase along with low dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures .
amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral ag@@ r@@ ust and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ vor@@ it@@ ages with the result of an education of non @-@ invasive , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
anti@@ viral activity of am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ ster@@ ous treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in the six@@ teen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ ossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a neurolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 62@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors treated patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to rub@@ b@@ abo@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be applied in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these mice with a reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral untreated patients , in which a F@@ ossi@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r containing a containing regim@@ ent ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and ti@@ lit@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) ev@@ oke .
inver@@ sely , Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the maintenance of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can affect the subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study involving PI pre@@ treated adults following vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ e- and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ le@@ verage threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with 288 HIV infected children aged between 2 and 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was used to intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline .
19 B@@ ased on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ cri@@ be should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI pre@@ processed children .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increases , for c@@ max against it by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of absorption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound ampl@@ itude remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the area of c@@ max , ss to c@@ min , ss .
for this reason , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ su@@ re@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to similar daily amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
these regim@@ ens lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day without con@@ current rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily application of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeu@@ tical application , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro diagnostics tests , which included reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical life by the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( ra@@ bb@@ its ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of as@@ re@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set down in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
508 % increases , for c@@ max against it by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day in the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are about 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the con@@ current administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to watch closely because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ ants would lower .
caution is advised if these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be undertaken as a precise predic@@ ting of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons to administ@@ er Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data available .
serum levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ isol@@ di@@ pine , and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study where rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) lead to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the dis@@ arm@@ ament in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures .
anti@@ viral activity of am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bit concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0,50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
inver@@ sely , Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the maintenance of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ cri@@ be should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI pre@@ processed children .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound ampl@@ itude remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of c@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
for this reason , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ su@@ re@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; hence the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be minor to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily application of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , there were little indications of the clinical relevance of these findings from the exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in k@@ itt@@ ens the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so that amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z )
in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards is indicated .
the use of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; acquired &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting has not been proven either with PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop swal@@ lowing the capsules once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ ur@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ generic ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl @-@ gly@@ co@@ gen hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to intake in inf@@ ants and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with ren@@ al failure contra@@ indicated .
con@@ current administration may result in a competitive dis@@ infection of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ re@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reli@@ eved for duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug 49 @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer @-@ lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
508 % increases , for c@@ max against it by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and cause P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral application of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us it may not be applied during pregnancy as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ ab@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r enters into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the dis@@ arm@@ ament in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during pregnancy .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of drugs or other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ ster@@ ous treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a stag@@ gering 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can affect the subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
62 B@@ ased on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ cri@@ be should be considered when optimi@@ zing treatment with PI pre@@ processed children .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approx . 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a is to be applied three times a week for a maximum of 16 weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied six weeks a week . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses , it is possible to apply three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin , so that it will remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before being washed off .
in all studies , al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks , al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo , either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of sal@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate was 15 % to 52 % in all four main studies treated with plac@@ ebo . • Results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a full healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the plac@@ ebo group compared to 0 % to 3 % .
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in face or scal@@ p in immune @-@ competent adults when the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has to continue until all visible fung@@ al war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the treated les@@ ions were cured by follow @-@ up 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be initiated ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient will be able to apply the cream as soon as he / she will notice this and then proceed with the usual treatment plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and in the cleaned , moist@@ ur@@ ized skin area to be rub@@ bed until the cream is fully absorbed .
there should be a consideration in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a consideration in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a tendency to circumc@@ ision were observed .
in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been available for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applications for the treatment of out@@ war@@ dly genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ al canal .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ination loss in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown lower effectiveness in this patient group with regard to the disposal of the F@@ eig@@ ners .
the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair approach was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical results of the therapy can be assessed according to the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have any clinical experience , therefore the application of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 cm2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears , or on the lip area within the lips of the lips .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally take off in the course of therapy of intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for several days .
data from an open clinical trial suggest that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions have a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , ent@@ ang@@ lement or post@@ nat@@ al development arise ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) are not quanti@@ fiable after a single use , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and considered likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects in the trials involving three @-@ week treatments were local reactions on the spot of treating the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ans ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and considered likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application site with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study reported side effects .
the most common , probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects were in these studies a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects indicated by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this assessment of the clinical signs provided according to the protocol shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials , with three @-@ week I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream it is common to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , exc@@ itation / de@@ fl@@ ation / shed ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) came ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this assessment of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scho@@ oling and sh@@ orting ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
acci@@ dental in@@ takes of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , corresponding to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was hyp@@ ot@@ ony that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s top@@ ical application .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was demonstrated that the efficacy in the treatment of an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment was significantly superior .
60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated the F@@ eig@@ B@@ ites completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo treated patients in the case ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ month application per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ fi@@ dence bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data available from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a related 25 cm2 area of treatment on the untreated scal@@ p or face .
one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two lines of treatment .
the approved indications extern@@ ally fung@@ al war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super @-@ fi@@ f@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and therefore have not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks res@@ p . ) .
a minimal systemic up@@ take of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three @-@ week application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10@@ times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of im@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application to MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis or super @-@ fi@@ rec@@ tive bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg were significantly reduced body weight and increased lac@@ tic weight ; a study of the der@@ mal application , conducted for four months , did not show any similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application site .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and does not suspect it is a risk for humans to look at the systemic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UV@@ R .
it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly adver@@ sely affect you or you notice side effects that are not specified in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

very common side effects in patients under 5 years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated rate heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ am@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly suscep@@ tible to hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that may be known , and where necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ ur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mamm@@ alian cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ am@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ ur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ ur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ am@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment where re@@ activation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the Phase 3 clinical trial , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Al@@ dur@@ am@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
since there is little experience in res@@ um@@ ing the treatment after a longer break , the theoretical elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions must be carefully prec@@ eded by an inter@@ ruption of the treatment .
treat 60 minutes before starting the inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a mild or medium inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered .
inf@@ usion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the pre@@ exp@@ ended reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time using chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
as there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ am@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug @-@ effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months following the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of trial in the patients under 5 years of age ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature ej@@ ection from the study ) , in 13 / 45 patients no det@@ ectable antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ ist version .
patients with inf@@ alli@@ ble or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the levels of G@@ AG in urine , whereas patients with high antibody ti@@ ters had a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ale to minor neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which seemed not affected by clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reas@@ oning for enzyme therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
after IV inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circul@@ atory system and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the central phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ iratory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with al@@ ur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated the plac@@ ebo group to improve lung function and capacity , which is shown in the following table .
in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks was shown in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V has not been clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the adult body size .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG level was observed in urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account the clin@@ ically significant changes spann@@ ing five efficacy rati@@ os ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minutes distance , movement range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , there was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe sequ@@ ential form and 4 with mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag@@ - levels in urine in week 22 during the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of course ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course form showed a normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe form @-@ form only limited or no advances in cognitive development were noted .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ ur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ages were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
intraven@@ ous 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a present@@ able alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines unless specified with the above 6,@@ 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided th@@ inning was under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

10 Prepar@@ ation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent vi@@ als to be dil@@ uted after body weight of each patient .
the holder of the approval for placing on the market has the following programme of study within the given time , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this tab will cover long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ am@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which cle@@ aves certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , is missing either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing altogether .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the constitu@@ ents of al@@ ur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , or if you have a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when applying Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking pharmaceuticals that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken drugs , including not prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lu@@ tion and application The concentrate for the production of an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted before application and is fores@@ een for the intraven@@ ous application ( see information for physicians or medical specialists ) .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
however , in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ ated involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , serious reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • Nau@@ sea • abdominal pain • Skin eff@@ usion • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • hei@@ ghtened pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the inf@@ usion point
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the package contents will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided th@@ inning was under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent vi@@ als to be dil@@ uted after body weight of each patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medi@@ cam@@ ents against cancer ) and mal@@ ign@@ ant ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack cell epithel@@ ial cells .
in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies , A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic drug &quot; should be administered before or after c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( Medic@@ ines against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent dehy@@ dra@@ tion ) .
in patients whose blood is changed or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , reduced or reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slo@@ ws down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to split .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is more suscep@@ tible to cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural ur@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 45@@ 6 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine for cancer ) .
in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9,@@ 3 months in c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7,@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack cell epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival compared to the compar@@ ative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to appro@@ ve A@@ lim@@ ta &apos;s placing in the entire European Union .
every pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved at 4.2 ml 0.9 % of sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( K@@ OF ) administ@@ ers intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² K@@ OF as an inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² K@@ OF is administered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the incidence and sever@@ ity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed gift and the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a minimum of 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dosage .
patients also have to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each application , including differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood sample or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive therapeutic cycles .
after the recovery , patients need to be treated according to the instructions in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for ALI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value prior to treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be ab@@ orted when in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ers a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients with 65 years of age or over 65 years old age 65 years old , there is an increased side effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical studies , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a reduction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ times the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; 3.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to bone disease immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number exceeds a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et cy@@ te number of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous cycles of treatment ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 of ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed are required to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ eic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including dehy@@ dra@@ tion , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion should be considered before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible gra@@ dation of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed exists , men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the sperm con@@ cre@@ tion prior to the treatment .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced pr@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be avoided in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data on the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the cl@@ ot@@ ting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Standards R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during an application in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if it is essential and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible gra@@ ding of the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm production .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed , and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as a mon@@ otherapy .
side effects of frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spon@@ tan@@ ous reports ) .
* Per@@ taining to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC version 2 for any toxic@@ ity level except the event &quot; Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &quot; * * which was derived from the term &quot; kidney / genital tract others . &quot; * * * Be@@ en to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) should be reported taste disorder and hair loss only as Grade 1 or 2 .

ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation with multiple Attack points by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are the key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
EMP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ ent@@ re , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ ial i@@ oma demonstrated that patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in combination with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural tube was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ a tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and wor@@ sen@@ ing lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ center , random@@ ized , open phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA to treat doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy followed a medi@@ an survival time of 8,3 months ( In@@ tent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7,@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , in patients with squ@@ am@@ ous cell carcin@@ oma in favor of do@@ x@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) are similar to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the Analy@@ ses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean PFS was 4.8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the impact of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in line with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ inferior limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te mer@@ gers ( 16,@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te mer@@ gers ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
patients also needed don@@ e- ten@@ er the gift of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 004 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0,0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed after injection as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were investigated in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in urine within 24 hours following the application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney fun@@ tion ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study of Be@@ agle dogs , which had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injec@@ tions for 9 months , tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( de@@ gen@@ e- ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epithel@@ ial tissue ) .
unless applied excell@@ ently , the retention periods and conditions after preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lu@@ tion has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
dissolve the content of the 100 mg diar@@ rhe@@ a with 4.2 ml 0.9 % So@@ dium chlori@@ de injec@@ tions solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the sample .
it is used for obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of the fats that feed the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg after one year recorded an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ eces , stu@@ ds , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ li@@ stat G@@ SK across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in combination with a light hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since or@@ li@@ stat is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • simultaneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption Syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • P@@ reg@@ n@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or obes@@ e diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist prior to a therapy with all@@ i as the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic needs to be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medi@@ cam@@ ents against high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist as to whether the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant contra@@ cep@@ tives in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contra@@ cep@@ tions in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ li@@ stat and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ li@@ stat , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally standar@@ dised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ li@@ stat in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure adequate vitamin up@@ take ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the application of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ li@@ stat at the same time , a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed .
animal experimental studies have shown no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported after the market launch of or@@ li@@ stat is unknown because these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ li@@ stat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal weight and over@@ weight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ li@@ stat over@@ dosing , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ li@@ stat .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the harmon@@ ic properties of or@@ li@@ stat can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect prev@@ ails in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the gast@@ ric and p@@ ank@@ re@@ static li@@ pas@@ s .
from clinical studies , 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat was taken three times a day , which blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ li@@ stat , which was taken three times a day in combination with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in the body weight compared with the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their original weight ( table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ li@@ stat were not measur@@ able 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ li@@ stat ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ aboli@@ zed or@@ li@@ stat in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and could be detected without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients who were given a minimal systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ t@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ Mol@@ l leu@@ cine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules and thereby result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks following the start of the treatment , as you may have not yet consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ise diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Start a few days , or better a week , before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and over the size of portions you normally consume .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ eli@@ hood that you exceed your fat limit will decrease . • Divi@@ de your recommended amount evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial night@@ stand , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying phenomena occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Don &apos;t use any ex@@ piration date indicated on the cardboard container . • Ke@@ ep permanently closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

a lasting weight loss , for example by improving diet and exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive influence on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat health@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the amount for you is suitable , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories you are capable of .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by resp@@ ecting the recommended intake of fats , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss while reducing the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutritional defici@@ encies .
34 . this reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not walk daily , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Middle physical activity &quot; means that you get 150 kcal per day , i.e. 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gar@@ dening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to ad@@ here to it . • A nutritional diary with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of further information materials that can help you feed calories and low @-@ fat and give guidelines to become physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a health@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your goal weight .
al@@ oh@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as anti@@ em@@ etic medication ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies involving 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with al@@ oh@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for al@@ oh@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2005 the European Commission granted to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd a permit for the placing of Alo@@ xi across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ oh@@ xi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in ven@@ om@@ ous chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strong chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable in case of simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to another chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic application , Alo@@ xi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in days following chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity directed against tum@@ ours ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady Stat@@ e- concentration oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , one C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on population , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 mc@@ g ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , who were at least related to al@@ oh@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration site ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and sor@@ eness ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships to be observed .
di@@ aly@@ sis studies have not been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ oh@@ em@@ ic over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g / m2 of micro@@ gram or 750 mc@@ g of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong treatment with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ron and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong chemical chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and d@@ ag@@ as@@ et@@ ron were comparable .
after clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ generation and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. administered p@@ alle@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.25 , 0,75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
absorption after intraven@@ ous injection follows a gradual reduction of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( c@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally proportional to the overall dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations indicate that at once a daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was compared to 3 consecutive days total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the value measured after a single intraven@@ ous dose ; however , the c@@ max was 0.75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the is@@ enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination of an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy volunteers , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al value time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increase , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified by this .
in pre @-@ clinical studies effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient to be considered sufficient over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 pre@@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular death and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily for more than two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low as for humans .

Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease induced by viral infection ) .
in a microsc@@ opic investigation , liver tissue damage has occurred , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood have been ab@@ normally elevated .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .

in addition , concerns have been expressed in a way that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be mark@@ eted will not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease again ret@@ arded in more patients than in the reference drug ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug uses an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) , is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ ins ( cra@@ cks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age the skin area should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin burns , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or from infections that have been det@@ ectable or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections exceed the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ ins , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd a permit for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully bl@@ ur@@ red and appropriate alternative therapy of infection began .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as path@@ ogen ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ ic@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area after a 2 or 3 day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected because of the low plasma concentrations found in humans after top@@ ical use on skin or infected surface wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 According to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean retin@@ os@@ ine AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and c@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % after top@@ ical application of healthy adult males .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical treatment in patients , dos@@ ages are not considered necessary if top@@ ical retin@@ ap@@ ic@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy only if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / stopped or the therapy continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman to weigh .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go have applied was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the administration site , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of operation Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocking partial P bin@@ dings and preventing normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should be considered based on the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ ulin at least some infection forms , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ os@@ glob@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us were observed , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ contact with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ cl@@ usion to intact and stri@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days of top@@ ical treatment of infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 cm2 di@@ ced skin ( c@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ic@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , with less participation of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro analysis of gen@@ mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 cm2 di@@ ced skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were noted .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
therefore , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and is ensured that the ino@@ cul@@ ation plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines act by ai@@ ding the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and creates antibodies .
Ambi@@ rix has the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult , which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 , and has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but twin children and twin children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan existing from three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals S.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the ground@@ breaking plan for pri@@ mers with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) are based on the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a hepatitis @-@ A- vaccine may need a vacc@@ ination vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standar@@ dis@@ ation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with immune system disorders , under certain circumstances , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies , so that in these cases the gift of further ino@@ cul@@ ation doses may be required .
since intra@@ cran@@ ial injection or intra@@ muscular administration could result in sub@@ optimal results , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ots , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected without exception , since it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration to bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune deficiency , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , ten@@ derness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ om@@ er and preserv@@ ative formulation .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines aged between 1 and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 up to and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the three @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ity on a calculation basis per V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the application of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects compared to 39,@@ 1 % in the subjects according to the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of val@@ ence was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. across the whole vaccine life of 39.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines who reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A- antibodies form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were obtained with a standard combination of three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was sel@@ ectable , the rates of ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ c@@ anned imp@@ etus significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses reported in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the table below .
in both studies , the ino@@ cul@@ ations received either a 2 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine with a combination @-@ vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years of pri@@ mers , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed following vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ GH antibodies is comparable to 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the detection of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults demonstrated the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ ation on possible foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state char@@ gen release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized to this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways such as bathing in water contaminated by wast@@ ewater .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect from infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both ino@@ cul@@ ate doses ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin , an antibiotic .
an allergic reaction can manifest itself by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . if you / your child has already occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier ino@@ cul@@ ation against hepatitis A or hepatitis B .
• If you want to quickly protect against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prescribed dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form @-@ in@@ activated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second dose of this vaccine with reduced amount of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection against completion of the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected under the skin and not in the muscles with people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . if you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ goes .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is to vacc@@ ination .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / received or given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , separate areas and as different limbs should be vacc@@ inated .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix will not be administered pregnant or nursing women unless it is urgent to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix &apos;s request inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data announced since the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix will remain positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ites can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ em@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ites - split on several single doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ ites could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a plac@@ ebo , i.e. without drug ) .
ammon@@ ites can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ainting , fluid retention , headache , f@@ ainting , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor , or weight gain .
the CH@@ MP ( CH@@ MP ) Committee concluded that ammon@@ ia effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia levels in patients suffering from the u@@ rea cycle .
ammon@@ ites were permitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of the approval , only limited information on this medicine was submitted .
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is then an indication for the use when hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ em@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early mani@@ f@@ ism deficiency in car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ acry@@ lam@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk to the origin of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma associated with ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is done over the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slo@@ wing neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased neur@@ on loss .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate box , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cy@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity for intraven@@ ous dos@@ ages of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , which is con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the condition with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was earlier almost always inf@@ ru@@ sted , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative path@@ ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated prior to the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ em@@ ic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with time in many mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ i@@ em@@ ic en@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are rarely reversible in treatment and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in the liver and kidney by glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous injection of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were measured 15 minutes after the intake .
in the majority of patients with u@@ rea cycle distur@@ ban@@ ces or ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20@@ g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after ni@@ ghtly fasting until the next morning .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is secre@@ ted by the kid@@ neys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no concl@@ usive effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ules is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children unable to swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ y or nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early mani@@ f@@ ism deficiency in car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ acry@@ lam@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when root fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , les@@ ions occurred in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral c@@ ort@@ ex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate box , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cy@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to u@@ rea ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess liquid
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the u@@ rea cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ule form , measur@@ able plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were measured 15 minutes after the intake .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this process , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if you are conducting laboratory tests , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you may not take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during breast@@ feeding as the medicine can go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , dis@@ appearance of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or contact your hospital for an appropriate treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in blood bil@@ e ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , abnormal skin smell , rash , kidney function distur@@ ban@@ ces , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly adver@@ sely affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
you may not use AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS according to the exp@@ iry date specified on the cardboard container and the container after &quot; Us@@ able up to &quot; exp@@ iry date .
like AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , and contents of the package AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the &quot; u@@ cy 500 &quot; embos@@ sing .
30 If you are conducting laboratory tests , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS to the same single doses or@@ ally or via a gast@@ ric duct ( hose that runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Send a straight edge , e.g. a knife over the edge of the measuring spoon , to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Rem@@ ove the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to heart ) , for example in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients under@@ going a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox was compared with common drugs or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
while PCI was often used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , other medicines have been used to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ anti@@ xi@@ mab and asp@@ ir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days or one year as effectively as the conventional treatment .
in patients who had under@@ gone a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in in relation to all indicators , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din , other mil@@ k@@ worm , or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and for a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd a permit for the placing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous stimul@@ us of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another sequence , an additional strain of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be res@@ um@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
an inf@@ usion of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous stimul@@ us of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us @-@ application of An@@ gi@@ ox was not tested and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT amounts , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the bolt dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ i@@ u@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of the Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• emin@@ ent hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against mil@@ k@@ ha@@ ins • active ble@@ edings or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in system and / or ir@@ reversible brain distur@@ ban@@ ces . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and acute bacterial En@@ do@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ val@@ ira is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if most arter@@ ial points occur in PCI @-@ patients with arter@@ ial points , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment , in principle , bleeding .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira reaches the level existing prior to treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ or ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din with plat@@ el@@ et aggreg@@ ation inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ ology parameters are regularly monitored .
the animal experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , un@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ira plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding performed significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ val@@ dru@@ n plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occur@@ ren@@ ces : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reducing the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed ble@@ edings , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ira in 6,000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine Group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
the following adverse events , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with a bi@@ valent oo@@ id@@ ine can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely monitored with regard to the signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ira , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ id inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and on the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of thro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or on cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din with serum was not induced to indu@@ ce plat@@ el@@ et aggreg@@ ation reaction ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is covered by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the patients , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ i@@ din should be added and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ went an angi@@ ography within 72 hours .
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and 1- year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients who received asp@@ ir@@ in and clo@@ pi@@ d gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or upper arm or administered as a permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or can &apos;t handle insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot effectively de@@ vise insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined by a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin l@@ is@@ per@@ es after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % at human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin sensitivity or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ venti@@ s Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or del@@ to@@ id or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of abdominal wall .
because of reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any changes in the effective strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ inc@@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement .
3 An insufficient dose or the ab@@ ort of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
switching a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
substances that increase blood sugar and increase prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diab@@ etic drugs , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ rami@@ de , fibr@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ ogenic oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the effect of sympath@@ e@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ dine and reser@@ pine may be the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin is over@@ stepp@@ ing into human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not exceed the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it absorbed after oral use .
listed below are the un@@ desirable drugs known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and ordered after decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is in@@ valuable ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess , excessive hun@@ - ger , head@@ aches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
a pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is om@@ itted to continuously change the injection point within the injection area , in which a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or treated by a doctor by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose .
after glu@@ co@@ ag@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral blood glucose ( especially by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin modul@@ is@@ in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose proportional to intake of a dose of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in the glucose @-@ lowering effect , just like human insulin .
insulin eu@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ amine effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin sensitivity was given 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin sensitivity is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as in a human normal insulin which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ ats before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin pulse in addition 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) before beginning of the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) and in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin sensitivity in addition 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal in comparison with human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
