<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. ingenious thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological condition in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">ABILIFY is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have referred to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased restlessness or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inhaling or the fusion tablets in patients who difficulties swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as ABILIFY, the dose of ABILIFY should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably works mainly as a "partial agonist" for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol works like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but to a lesser degree than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of ABILIFY to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three trials up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased restlessness over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, ABILIFY was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of ABILIFY and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients who had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of ABILIFY injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased restlessness, compared with that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined patients' symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients addressing the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received ABILIFY in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-term studies as placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">ABILIFY also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes of previously treated patients up to 74 weeks compared to placebo and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">ABILIFY injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of ABILIFY to intake (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled choking), somnolence (drowsiness), somnolence (nausea), fatigue and fatigue (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes matched the treatment with Aripiprazol, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the advantages of injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with a manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of ABILIFs across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar confusion and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mainly had manic episodes and associated their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in dosages with a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-ion disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">In consideration of the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and has been reported in some cases after beginning or after an antipsychotic therapy, even in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased suicide risk associated with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesien: in clinical studies that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia when treated with ABILIFY, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with aria prazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextrometorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextrometorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of the insufficient data exposure to safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk of fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole included a lower incidence of EPS including Parkinson's, dystonia and dyskinesia compared to those treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients underwent aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with reliefulin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Some episodes in bipolar-I disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 53.3% in patients undergone Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">The enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4) are among the side effects reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information on the effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose is of benefit since Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazol showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receiver and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the application of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receiver ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and on the putamen.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who had a response to study mediation were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which primary study target 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superior effect compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazol showed a placebo-superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of Lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazol showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features which in some cases did not apply to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement period for 74 weeks with manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in view of the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazol, which catalyzes N-Dealkylation by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination Stone Age is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol in extensive metabolisers over CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">There was no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with varied liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so that they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinse toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Cholelithiasis was also observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the Sulfate Conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazol, found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg, were no more than 6% of concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the bile of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3- and 111s of the mean Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">As soon as it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazol injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicine already used for maintenance or acut therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an oral treatment with Aripiprazol is indicated, see summary of the characteristics of the medicine to acquire ABILIFY tablets, ABILIFY Melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazol's injection solution in patients with detrimental and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution as necessary, patients should be observed in regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions which predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a mns are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia patients and patients with bipolar deficiency because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">However, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared with that after allusion of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy subjects of Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) were administered intramuscularly and simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">Compared to CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be lifted to the dose level prior to the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>

<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients underwent aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium therapy.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">The enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, adverse cerebrovascular events, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4) are among the side effects reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant greater improvement of detachment / behavioural dysfunction compared with placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggibility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms in relation to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe detachment, a similar efficacy was observed in terms of the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenia patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who had a response to study mediation were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression-rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction of the declining rate was found for Aripiprazol (oral), which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which primary study target 'weight gain' was, significant fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features which in some cases did not apply to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo in view of the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazol AUC is 90% greater than AUC after the same dose as tablet; the systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time to the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15 and 5 times higher than the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">Studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application showed no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which lay in 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinse toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration and as a monotherapy) was compared with the medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>

<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to one month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">In the treatment with Abraxane, male patients should be advised to have an irreversibly infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) that can affect the transport capability and the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The most common and most important cases of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer were listed in the pivotal Phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the gift of Abraxane as a monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>

<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubules agent that promotes the amalgamation of the microtubules from the tubular-indims and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin induces the transport of albumin through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed through the gp-60-albuminreczeptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour is presented due to the albumbilizing protein SPARC (leukodic protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of mBC for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arms and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was administered in the form of an infusion of about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received paclitaxel therapy every 3 weeks, either in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour premedication for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a negative overall condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>

<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy for a period of time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the sound of baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substance (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10. after intravenous treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or binding closure of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane donation (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue histopathies it is reported that paclitaxel is first and foremost metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of the unchanged active ingredient was less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Educational broschure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packaging. • With clear visual representation of the correct application of the product, cooling boxes for transport by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that abseamed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same drug (also referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels in which complications can occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor as long as they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">All patients' iron values must be monitored before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, an anemia can be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency, or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">When administered, Abseamed was compared to a vein as part of a primary study involving 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of efflute effected under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from anemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abseamed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headache and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Secretion as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems, as further studies are required to make sure there are no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that, according to the provisions of the European Union, it has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which produces abseamed, will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma that receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion exists due to the general condition (for example cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate in case of planned larger operative procedures that require a large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In order to reduce foreign blood, Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, where high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>

<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and disease may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values above or below the hemoglobin target concentration can occasionally be observed in a patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this haemoglobin variability an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the enduring haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest possible dose which is required for control of anemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and impairments may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this haemoglobin variability an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest permitted dose which is required to control the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozyte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Reticuloid count &lt; 40.000 t / µl compared to the baseline value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of the haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozyte number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Reticulozyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned is required, were received twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the autologous blood donation programme begins.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days each, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given via the tube of a fistula to the end of dialysis, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythropoetin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) in the treatment with some erythropoetin should not receive abseamed or another erythropoetin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. anamnesite known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying disease: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of the carcass or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenie (PRCA) Very seldom has been reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of action, defined as a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for a failure to address (iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminous toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are studied.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Reticulocyte value, taking into account the anemia (i.e. the Reticulocytes "Index") is low (i.e. the Reticulocytes "Index"), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason for an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentrations in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the use of epoeines if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the anemia and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidence-resistant coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentrations in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, treatment of anemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In case of tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response should be considered for assessing the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapeutic anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisaged for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anemia should be examined before the start of epoetin alfa therapy and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular disease, especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, treatment with epoetin alfa can lead to an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events when treating epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>

<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dosage should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding haematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>

<seg id="578">Compared to all patients suffering from Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies) with those taking placebo, the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Aclaw had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients taking placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta adverse events occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonate patients, Aclasta inhibits the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteoneksis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaws.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta "s manufacturer provides reconnaissance material for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as a similar material to patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted Novartis Europharm Limited a permit for the placing of Aclasta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis - in postmenopausal women • in men with an increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic femoral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic femoral fractures, the administration of the infusion of Aclaw is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclaw should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclaw, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently experienced low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms experienced within the first three days after the administration of Aclaw can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see Section 4.4) In Patients with a Kreatinine Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>

<seg id="599">Aclaw is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinine-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Before the beginning of therapy with Aclasta, pre-existing hypocalemia is to be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid deployment of the effect of Zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs normally within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient intake of calcium, respectively, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer (chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be considered before applying bisphosphonate to a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">There is no data available for patients who need dental interventions, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonate decreases the risk of osteoarthritis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms experienced within the first three days after Aclaw can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after applying Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of fibrillation reported as serious side effects was increased in patients receiving Aclaw (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0,6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledroneic acid was associated with renal dysfunction (i.e. an increase of the serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinine clearing (measured annually before the administration) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis more than three years comparable between the Aclasta and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatine in 10 days after application was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclaw compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, temporary asymptomatic levels of calcium found below the normal range (less than 2.10 mmol / l) were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclaw in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to prevent clinical fractures after hip fractures and in the Morbus-Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently suffered fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but most of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After administration of Zoledroneic acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions to the infusion point, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteochrosen in the jaw area was reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteoarthritis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonate, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteoporosis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after dental extractions or other dental interventions.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients showed osteonnecrosis in the jaw area in one with Aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclaw 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women aged 65-89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) -T-Score for the femoral cavity at ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fractures.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on spinal fractures of Aclaw decreased significantly over a period of three years, as well as the frequency of one or more new bone fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclaw-treated patients 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclaw increased bone density in lumbar vertebral acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the thighth by 5.1%, and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken a year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic sludge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volume compared with placebo and the receipt of trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5-mg dose Aclasta decreased significantly by 30% after 12 months compared with baseline and was kept at 28% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.E. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclaw, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, Aclaw treated the BMD at all times in comparison to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">Aclaw treatment resulted in more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment, increasing the BMD by 5.4% at the total head and by 4.3% at the lower leg.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOl446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta compared to the once weekly administration of Alendronat was not subject to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in Aclaw Disease Paget was examined in patients and patients over 30 years of age with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderate morbus passport of the bone (mean serum levels of the alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2,6fold to 3.0fold age-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg. of risedronate once a day during 2 months was proven in two six months comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain strength and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared with baseline for Aclasta and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Aclasta and 107 with Risonronat patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of patients treated with Aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risonronat, during an average follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiples 5 and 15 minutes permanent infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large circulation with half-value times t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a prolonged elimination phase with a terminal Eliminationshal time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, whereas the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total Body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, drug-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of zoledroneic acid correlated with the creatinine clearing, namely 75 ± 33% of creatine clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 examined patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction down to a creatine clearance up to 35 ml / min. no dose adjustment of zoledronic acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there are only limited data for severe kidney function (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-sequential intravenous one dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6 times of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subjunctive and chronic toxicity In trials with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledroneic acid was administered in rats by dose of 0.6 mg / kg as 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7fold of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, corresponds to), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">Long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure were toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of long bones in the growth phase with nearly all dosages, an attack that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resortive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was expressed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum levels of serum.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance that is called bisphosphonates and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and women's Disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, mainly estrogens made from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget the bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is structured uniformly, which makes bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta inhibits bone reconstruction, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus regaining strength.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When applying Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can additionally be applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonylurea or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with sulfonylurea, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of Actos' additional donation to the existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyl resins showed a decrease of HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional donation of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c levels of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in the patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirror - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for placing Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until whitish, round, domed and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease) to develop a decompensated heart failure, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms which point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overstomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite, and / or dark urine, liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are passed.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemodilution, a minor reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) appeared below the therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocripits by 3.6-4.1%) and reduced levels of haemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits around 1-3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazon as oral double or triple combination therapy with sulfonylurea or as two-fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the introduction of thiazolidindia, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of a diabetic macular edema with reduced visual acuity was reported.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated incidence of Fraktur was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wants pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment must be stopped (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC of Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the reduction in hyperinsulinaemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal while reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refraction index of the lens, as observed also with other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone ALT-Anstiege performed more than three times the upper limit of the normal range as often as placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazone resumed.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch, it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure in pioglitazone, but more frequently if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study spanning over a period of 3.5 years, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days, no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to function via activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and improves peripheral glucose utilization in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazide as a monotherapy was carried out over two years to investigate the time up to the treatment of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study for 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was sufficiently adjusted with insulin for three months was randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, Pioglitazon consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of the overall plasma triglycerides and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol was observed as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plasmatriglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliobazide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed in pioglitazone, while values reduced under metformin and gliobazide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, both with an effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing progressive macrovascular disease were randomized in groups, who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral use, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the highest concentrations of immutable pioglitazone in the plasma normally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, M-IV's contribution to efficacy corresponds to the triple the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Studies have shown that Pioglitazone does not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or decreases the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After orally use of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies, mice, rats, dogs and monkeys complied with repeated administration of plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the reduction in hyperinsulinaemia resulting in the gestation and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal while reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced in the rat.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindicons led to increased frequency of colontal tumours.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated incidence of Fraktur was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in patients treated with Pioglitazon and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined with pioglitazone or glide-azide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, Pioglitazon consistently showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone did not only reduce the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, both with an effect on tryglyceride absorption and hepatic tryglizard synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacking in terms of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, strokes, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above ankles, coronary vascularisation and vascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the labeling "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients receiving comparative medication, increased incidence of bone fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1,0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum harnness levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of rheumatism, so that less than 3% of patients needed a rheumatic boost in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of the patients did not need treatment for a rheumatic boost).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the density of the plaster nodes, which resulted in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the bursting nodes by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µs / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuuxostat (5.0%) and received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentrations time curve (AUC) increased from Febuuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febiostat, which is larger than the dose proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of Febuuxostat amounts to approximately 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration range, which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febiosta glucuronid is mainly created by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuuxostat, about 49% of the dose was found in urine as an unchanged Febuuxostat (3%), the oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">Aside from the excretion of urine, approximately 45% of the dose was found in the stool as an unchanged Febuuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), whose known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the cmax of Febuuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuuxostat increased about 1.8-fold of 7.5 μ of ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.2 μ of ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary tumors (transitional cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, in approximately the 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolism and primeval composition and considered not relevant for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, linuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, which accompanied by lowering of the rearing performance and a developmental delay in the descendants of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Studies with Alendronat The therapeutical equality of Alendronat once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg. a day (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study on postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fractures incidence in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) as well as in the questionnaire intervention study (FIT: N = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In the phase III studies, the moderate ascents of BMD with alendronate were 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spinal column, 5.9% at the femur and 7.8% on the conchanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">Compared to the placebo group, in the group treated with Alendronat a 48% reduction (Alendronat 3.2% vs Plazebo 6.2%) was achieved in the share of patients who suffered one or more spinal fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of the BMD of the spinal column and the conchanter continued; the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo controlled trials, where Alendronat was taken daily (5 mg. a day for 2 years and then 10 mg. a day either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily application of Alendronat reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal correction by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% vs. Plazebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Beaded on an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nightly fastings and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability increased correspondingly to about 0.46% and 0.39%, when Alendronat was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies, Alendronat was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, the gift of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day for five days) led to no clinically significant change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies have shown that Alendronat is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intravenous injection of 1 mg / kg but then quickly dispersed into the bones or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion According to intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C Alendronate approximately 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the wood.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronat was 71 ml / min and systemic Clearance was not 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronat is not excreted in rats using the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that the excretion of other medicines by humans is influenced by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1335">In the case of a radically marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects, the mean excretion of radioactivity in the urine was 2.4% in the urine after 48 hours, in the subjects after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients preclinical studies have shown that the share of alendronate, which is not stored in the bone, is quickly excreted via the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although there is no clinical data about it, it is nevertheless expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal studies will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation, whereby the application of advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example, examining how often a re-transplant or re-recording of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, more than 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were conducted and examined how Advantage is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with the immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; reformulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narrow-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advantages should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood mirroring (see "Recommendations below").</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advantf, the tacrolimus levels should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks of transplantation under Advantage to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the lawyer's scheme can take several days until Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switching from Prograf to Advantages Must a transplant recipient of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to be converted into a daily intake of Advantages, this conversion has to take place in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to Advantandia once a day, the treatment with the oral initials recommended in kidney and liver transplantation must start for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adults who are switched to Advantages, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with lawyers in lung, pancreas and colorectal transplanted patients, received Prograf in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, in an oral initial dose of 0,2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood flow in the targeted range can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe hepatic dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with renal function since renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum creatine levels, a calculation of creatininin and a monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advantage When converting a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in a single case with the aid of thoroughbred Tacrolimus-Talke controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks of transplantation, followed by periodic inspections during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to anagraf, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances that could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since advancing is a medicinal product with low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the level of tacrolimus in whole blood is usually in the first time after liver transplantations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always keep the same Tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; reformulation of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narrow-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 To treat adult patients with graft rejection, which have been treated as therapy agents to other immunosuppressants, there is no clinical data available for the retardated formulation of Advantages.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant receivers and graft receivers in childhood there are no clinical data for the retardated formulation of Advantages.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions, which may lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies during treatment with lawyers (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is provided, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, it was possible to observe a chamber or septum hypertrophy called cardiomyopathy, which may therefore occur under Advantanate.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are already existing heart diseases, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar control with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">Since Advantations contain hard capsules, retardent, lactose, special caution is recommended in patients with the rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while taking substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain even concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">Strong interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and vorythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the rise in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolon, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Tacrolimus's effect on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since Tacrolimus can reduce the clearing of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone exposure, decisions about contraception are particularly careful.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearing of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that in comparison to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialytic.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus should be mediated by its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent isolation of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocyins (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ -interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound group of tacrolimus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolised prior to excretion, with excretion mainly done through the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) in advocacy (AUC0-24) was nearly 10% lower than in Prograf, for stable patients who have been converted from Prograf (twice a day) to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advent is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital heart defect caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application determine whether Advances for the treatment of bleeding or preventing haemorrhages are applied in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced according to a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advent is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union, but is produced differently, so that the medicine does not contain any protein or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bleeding complications was assessed as "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of lawyers (observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>

<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following haemorrhagic events, factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to Factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and show different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be dosages between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII-plasma activities are not reached, or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, the factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The enrolment rate is to be directed following the patient's finding, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in treating patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of Factor VIII, IgG immunoglobulins which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 repositioning days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnessus known inhibitory development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-triggers) inhibitors was observed.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to assess the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the security profile of ADVOC, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further renewal measures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Human Use (CHMP) that the company accepts its application for approval for the placing of the advexin on the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissue (tissue that connects other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) is affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies produced by themselves and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have injected directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to rebuild the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and the killing of the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and cancer cells can grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni-Cancer occurred in the area of undermining, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP tested the answers of the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the original documents submitted, the CHMP will create a list of questions that will be sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or compassionate-use programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "changed mode of action" "" "" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective constituents will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by an allergy to Pollen from nasal paths) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and youths from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the mucous mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main factors were the changes in severity of the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hayfever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients who took aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under aerinaze showed a 37.4% relief compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients against adrenergic active ingredients or loratadine (another medicine used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze must not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (cerebral haemorrhage) or haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe a permit for the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow as a whole (i.e. without tearing it apart, to crush or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children less than 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term application can reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadine as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within the 2 weeks following such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergoid, lihydroergotamine or other deongestiva that are peroral or nasal as deviant rhinologichum (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazolin, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment with hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches) must be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">• Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck instructions, or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be stopped at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines have otherwise been able to prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadine where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test there were no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo, no matter if desloratadine alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of disloratadine has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmfulness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not raise the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstricting properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness that may result in impairment of transport capability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lettering.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmia, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, pupil stiffness and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophilen and the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, the Lloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance, including reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness than placebo recommended in the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestation of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, where 414 patients received aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets, determined by the total scores for the symptoms (except mucous mucous swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucous swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">In terms of gender, age or ethnicity, the effectiveness of aerinaze tablets did not show any significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after the administration is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of desloratadine, 3-Hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi dose study, which was performed using the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test subjects were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (cmax and AUC) from pseudoephedrine following the sole dose of pseudoephedrine bioequivalents was for exposure according to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadine does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratine / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the pharmacovigilance system described in Module 1.8.1 is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines help relieve the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, and its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of deserloratadine very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, nettle rash and swellings) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of heart palpitations, heart hunting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, muscular pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of liver inflammation and cases of conspicuous liver lesions was also rarely reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg Lyophilisat for inserting (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg-melt tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml-solution for intake.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrupulp resp.</seg>
<seg id="1722">AERIUS was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness has been measured by determining the symptoms (itching, number and size of the squares, affecting the sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to intake and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg AERIUS showed an average decrease of the symptom (symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials at Urticaria, the decrease in symptoms after six weeks with AERIUS 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of desloratadine in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and may end after the symptom severity and can be resumed during their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended during the allergy time a continuing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered in addition (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, alcohol is not amplified while taking AERIUS and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness that may result in impairment of transport capability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg per day in patients with AERIUS than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17, the most frequent side effect was headache, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, at which up to 45 mg of deserloratadine (nine times clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophilen and the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses given up to 20 mg. a day in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which deserloratadine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times of the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, the Lloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance, including reinforcement of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, AERIUS was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified as an alternative also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the total quality of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, AERIUS effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the etiology of the different forms and chronic patients can be recruited more easily prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine infection is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadine will also lead to an improvement of the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronically idiopathic urticaria, AERIUS was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in the chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines from the study was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with AERIUS significantly reduced the disorder of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients-demoographies were comparable with the general seasonal allergic Rhinitis population, a higher concentration of Desloratadine was achieved in 4% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation following a daily application of desloratadine (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of disloratadine has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadine inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>

<seg id="1763">AERIUS can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see under Section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious Rhinitis with AERIUS.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadine and experience higher substantive load (see section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood has been judged that the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of ascribe is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, the Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, excluding Ritonavir, in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The low-dose Ritonavir medicinal product Agenerase was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously taken no proteasinhibitors, more patients underwent viral load less than 400 copies / mL in 48 weeks compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults treated with protease inhibitors, the medicinal product Agenerase increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, the viral load of the viral load decreased after four weeks compared with ritonavir as in the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amponavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement to treat depression) or medicines which are mined in the same way as ascribe and are detrimental to high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the rejuvenating immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years were predominant over the course of four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic preamplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefit of assurease in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>

<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing of asgenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">In combination with other antiretroviral medicines, Agenerase is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic padding of amponavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amponavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amponavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amponavir as capsule; hence, Agenerase capsules and solution are not exchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amponavir twice daily together with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of asrease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amponavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amponavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not investigated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Generic ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude and are also represented by substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amponavir during ingestion of amponavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with asrease, does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver dysfunction with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of an antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function including chronic-active hepatitis indicate an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Simultaneous use of Agenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids which are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and Simvastatin depends strongly on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who are taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amponavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amponavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given simultaneously with amponavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for ompiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propyl-glycogen content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be cancelled in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported about diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases associated with the treatment of medicines which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In haemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemothrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) which leads to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher Body-Mass Index), cases of osteoneksis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term application of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic latitude must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic latitude and are also represented by substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic beam Agenerase with ritonavir may not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with elevated plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that rifampicin causes 82% reduction in AUC of amponavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the low plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors combined with ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amponavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already engaged in St. John's wort, the amabavirus levels are and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amponavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for cmax against it by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amponavir were used twice a day and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% is humbled when amponavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amponavir in plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of amponavir (600 mg / 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the concurrent administration of amponavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended to watch closely because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with Didanosin in combination with Didanosin, but due to the antacids component of Didanosin it is recommended that the income of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amabavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required in combination with amabavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amabavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteasants would lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may lowers the serum concentration of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is advised if these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be undertaken as a precise predicting of the effect of the combination of amponavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous application of Amprenavir and Rifabutin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193% and thus a rise in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If clinical reasons are required to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic trials with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of concurrent administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of two times daily 700 mg. of Fossiamprenavir and 100 mg ritonavir with 200mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the cmax of ketoconazole in plasma around 25% and the AUC (0) compared to the value observed after 200mg ketoconazole once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors, or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions together with assurease.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs when applied in combination with assurease.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as assurease since it can lead to absorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as an enzyme sector (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amponavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, niisoldipine, and verapamil can be increased by amponavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake of Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and intensify with PDE5 inhibitors associated with PDE5 inhibitors including livery livery, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol increased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous application of generic ase with ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are expected to increase the plasma levels of plasma levels while administering ageneric ase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma picks of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy, including Rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amponavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, since the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased while using amponavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, assurease cannot be applied together with Midazolam (see Section 4.3), which is recommended with parenteral midazolam while using Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amponavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for ompiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at this time, just as the amponavir dosage is to be adjusted if amponavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Standards Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with the simultaneous gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may be applied only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, amabavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether amponavir enters into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given by the disarmament in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amponavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to the use of drugs or other medicines used at the same time, or whether they are a result of underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the above-mentioned side effects stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study mediation and performed at more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">113 anti-retroviral individuals who had been treated with amabavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudin over a mean duration of 36 weeks was only one case (bull's jaws) (&lt; 1%) observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pretreated patients under amponavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematrous or makulopapulous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amponavir had to be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis are reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term treatment of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day together with low dosed ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those observed with allusion of triglyceride and CPK values, which were very common in patients who received aurease along with low dose of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amponavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral agrust and gag-pol- polyproteinvoritages with the result of an education of non-invasive, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity of amabavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibit concentration (IC50) of amabavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amponavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as in other ritonavir-oosterous treatment regimens with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the sixteen of 434 antiretroviral untreated patients who received 700mg of Fossiamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a neurological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice daily: N = 107) with protease inhibitors treated patients with virological failure over 96 weeks following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based analysis of genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to rubbabor and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic analysis systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be applied in combination with genotypic data for estimating the activity of amputavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these mice with a reduced sensitivity to amponavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between amponavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral untreated patients, in which a Fossiamprenavir containing a containing regiment (one of 25 isolates), Darinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tilitavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates) evoke.</seg>
<seg id="2033">Inversely, Amuravir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the maintenance of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which can affect the subsequent treatment adversely.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study involving PI pretreated adults following virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred three- and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-leverage threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with 288 HIV infected children aged between 2 and 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was used to intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22,5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed ritonavir at the same time; the majority of the patients with PI previously had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the anticipated benefits of "unbleached" ascribe should be considered when optimizing treatment with PI preprocessed children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for cmax against it by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amponavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amponavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amponavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approx. 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amponavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amabavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amplitude remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State via the area of cmax, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">For this reason, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with assurease (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to similar daily amponavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amponavir is less bioavailable from the solution than from the capsules; hence, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible, hence the effect of renal dysfunction to the elimination of amponavir and ritonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amponavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of amponavir twice a day without concurrent ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amabavir on mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occured in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8- (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily application of 1200 mg of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and therapeutical application, showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro diagnostics tests, which included reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberration tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, amponavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical life by the measurement of AST, ALT and the activity of the alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical studies, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus-ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of asrease (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amponavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amponavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be set down in duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors such as a longer-lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that rifampicin causes 82% reduction in AUC of amponavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increases, for cmax against it by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amponavir in plasma, which were achieved twice a day in the combination of amponavir (600 mg / 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are about 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the concurrent administration of amponavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended to watch closely because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amabavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both proteasants would lower.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Caution is advised if these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be undertaken as a precise predicting of the effect of the combination of amponavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is required for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin along with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there is no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, niisoldipine, and verapamil can be increased by amabavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol increased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Standards Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) lead to a decrease in AUC and Cmin of amponavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Antiviral activity of amabavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibit concentration (IC50) of amabavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM with acutely infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells (1 µM = 0,50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Inversely, Amuravir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; the maintenance of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the anticipated benefits of "unbleached" ascribe should be considered when optimizing treatment with PI preprocessed children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound amplitude remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Steady State via the range of cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of amponavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from amponavir as capsule; hence, Agenerase capsules and solution are not exchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should stop swallowing the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase Solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) Amuravir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2800 mg of amponavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, as there is no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of Agenerase solution to intake and low dose of ritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for amponavir is not deemed necessary, an application of Ageneric ase is contraindicated in patients with renal failure (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propyl-glycogen halts, Agenerase is a solution to intake in infants and children under the age of 4, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with renal failure contraindicated.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Concurrent administration may result in a competitive disinfection of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as cardiac arrhythmia (z).</seg>
<seg id="2106">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>

<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratosis on eyelids, inside the nose or ears, or on the lip area within the lips of the lips.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the underarms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally take off in the course of therapy of intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial suggest that patients with more than 8 ac- lesions have a lower total cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immunostimulatory properties, Imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">From animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, entanglement or postnatal development arise (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) are not quantifiable after a single use, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and considered likely or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod cream in connection with side effects in the trials involving three-week treatments were local reactions on the spot of treating the Feignians (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and considered likely or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod cream in connection with side effects include discomfort at the application site with a frequency of 28,1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by 185 with Imiquimod cream treated basaliom patients from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod cream in connection with side effects were in these studies a response to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimod cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This assessment of the clinical signs provided according to the protocol shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials, with three-week Imiquimod cream it is common to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excitation / deflation / shed (23%) and oil (14%) came (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">This assessment of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream is very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe schooling and shorting (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Accidental intakes of 200 mg of Imiquimod, corresponding to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was hypotony that normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after Imiquimod's topical application.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, it was demonstrated that the efficacy in the treatment of an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment was significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of the patients treated with Imiquimod treated the FeigBites completely; this was 20% of the 105 with placebo treated patients in the case (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five-month application per week for 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed individual primary superfidence basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data available from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically healed and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, hyperkeratotic, hypertrophic lesions within a related 25 cm2 area of treatment on the untreated scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">One-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two lines of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications externally fungal warts, actinic keratosis and super-fifal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and therefore have not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">In these studies, the efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks resp.).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic uptake of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was about 10times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of immiquimod after topical application to MC-infected skin of patients aged 6 - 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or super-firective basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg were significantly reduced body weight and increased lactic weight; a study of the dermal application, conducted for four months, did not show any similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumors at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and does not suspect it is a risk for humans to look at the systemic exposure as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects will significantly adversely affect you or you notice side effects that are not specified in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignices (Condylomata acuminata), which have formed on the skin in the area of genitals (genitals) and anus (anus) ● surface basal cell carcinoma This is a frequently encountered, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to abnormalities, especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to sunlight during their previous lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied in case of flat actinic keratoses in the face and scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the surface basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have previously applied Aldara cream or other similar drugs, please inform your doctor about this before you start treatment. o Use Aldara cream until the area to be treated after a previous medication or surgical treatment is healed ist. o Avoid contact with eyes, lips and mucosa.</seg>
<seg id="2249">In case of accidental contact, remove the cream from rinse with water. o Do not stir the cream inwardly. o Do not use more cream than your doctor prescribed to you. o Ceiling your treated area after applying Aldara cream do not occur with a bandage or bandage. o If reactions occur at the treated place that give you strong discomfort, wash the cream with a mild soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="2250">Once the reactions have cleared, you can continue the treatment. o Find your doctor if they have no normal blood</seg>
<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, thinning of the skin, or difficulty in withdrawing the foreskin can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Apply aldara cream not in the urethra (urethra), in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or inside the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medicines cause serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area sexual intercourse, the treatment with aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Breastfeed your infant during treatment with aldara cream, since it is not known whether Imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of fungal warts, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream on the clean, dry skin spot with the foils and rub the cream cautiously on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area under it (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before applying Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks, apply a sufficient amount of Aldara cream for 5 days a week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>
<seg id="2262">Very common side effects (expected for more than 1 out of 10 patients) frequent side effects (to be expected in less than 1 out of 100 patients) rare side effects (to be expected in less than 1 out of 1,000 patients) Very rare side effects (to be expected in less than 1 out of 10,000 patients)</seg>
<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist about it immediately if you do not feel well during the Aldara cream application.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with aldara cream, you should not use the cream to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and notify your doctor or your pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to get a blue stain more quickly, or it can cause dejection.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly adversely affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions that resound within 2 weeks of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, shotting, skin destruction, bubbles, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the place of application (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, swollen eyes, ulceration, warmth or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucous membrane, nasal irritation, actinic keratosis, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, link pains, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that do not arise with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Alduramyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Alurazyme administration should be administered in a hospital or clinic with reactivation devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study examines the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect in reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years, Aldurazyme lowered the concentrations of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aluracyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under 5 years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measuring size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated rate heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Alduramyme may not be used in patients who may be highly susceptible to hypersensitivity (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may be known, and where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive alurazyme in terms of the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to approve Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, egg stock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Alduramyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aluracyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aluracyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosage scheme can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Alduramyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment where reactivation facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the Phase 3 clinical trial, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when applying Alduramyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in resuming the treatment after a longer break, the theoretical elevated risk of hypersensitivity reactions must be carefully preceded by an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Treat 60 minutes before starting the infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or medium infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preexpended reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used at the same time using chloroquin or procaine because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As there is no data on newborns exposed to laronidase over mother's milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Alduramyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older in a duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre-history, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug-effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a seroconversion within 3 months following the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe form of trial in the patients under 5 years of age (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature ejection from the study), in 13 / 45 patients no detectable antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with whom it never came to seroist version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with infallible or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the levels of GAG in urine, whereas patients with high antibody titers had a variable reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginale to minor neutralizing inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which seemed not affected by clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning for enzyme therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulatory system and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients from the central phenotype and only one patient referred to the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with alurazyme treated the placebo group to improve lung function and capacity, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">In the open extension study, improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks was shown in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV has not been clinically significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the adult body size.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the GAG level was observed in urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between patients taking into account the clinically significant changes spanning five efficacy ratios (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in 6-minutes distance, movement range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted, in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe sequential form and 4 with mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in urine in week 22 during the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of course (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle course form showed a normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe form-form only limited or no advances in cognitive development were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different alurazyme dosages were performed on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">Intravenous 100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a presentable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with a unique gift, toxicity with repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine for cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicaments against cancer) and malignant (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that does not attack cell epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In combination with cisplatin and patients who have previously received other chemotherapies, Alimta is used as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, an "antiemetic drug" should be administered before or after cisplatin (Medicines against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent dehydration).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood is changed or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, reduced or reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrexed thus slows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to split.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form is more susceptible to cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural urothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">In addition, Alimta was compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9,3 months in cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7,9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with cancer did not attack cell epithelial cells during the administration of Alimta for longer survival compared to the comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to approve Alimta's placing in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Every piercing bottle must be dissolved at 4.2 ml 0.9% of sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">In combination with cisplatin, ALIMTA is indicated for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion for a period of 2 hours approx. 30 minutes after Pemetrexed- Infusion the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell carcinoma after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed gift and the day after the treatment a corticosteroid must be given.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, a minimum of 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving Pemetrexed, a complete blood-image should be created before each application, including differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking account of the Nadirs of the blood sample or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the predictive therapeutic cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients need to be treated according to the instructions in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as a monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grad 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted when in patients after 2 dose reducers a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients with 65 years of age or over 65 years old age 65 years old, there is an increased side effect.</seg>
<seg id="2386">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatine clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a reduction of &gt; 1.5-times the upper Bilirubin- limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; 3.0-times the upper limit value (in the case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to bone disease immunosuppression and Pemetrexed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils number exceeds a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet cyte number of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils number, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous cycles of treatment (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 of haematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed are required to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinine-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non-steroidal anti-phlogistics (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyleic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for treatment with Pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion should be considered before the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible gradation of the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed exists, men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the sperm concretion prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min), high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can result in reduced premetrexed excretion with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid can be avoided in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data on the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life like Piro- xicam or rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the clotting status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Standards Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be applied during pregnancy, except if it is essential and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of an irreversible grading of the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm production.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed infant cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomised cisplatin and Pemetrexed, and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as a monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or obese diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist prior to a therapy with alli as the dosage of the antidiabetic needs to be adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally standardised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure adequate vitamin uptake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the application of a single dose of Amiodarone was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers, who received orlistat at the same time, a minor decrease in Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies have shown no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of adverse events reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown because these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal weight and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects that can be attributed to the harmonic properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect prevails in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonds to the active serin-rest of the gastric and pankrestatic lipass.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, 60 mg orlistat was taken three times a day, which blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a low-calorie, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in the body weight compared with the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their original weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3,5% (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3,6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and could be detected without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients who were given a minimal systemic resorbated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Moll leucine group), were identified, representing approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine used as antiemetic medication).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies involving 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with alohxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for alohxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2617">Alohxi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in venomous chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi to prevent nausea and vomiting, induced by a strong chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable in case of simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to another chemotherapeutic application, Aloxi is not to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in days following chemotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 mcg (a total of 633 patients), who were at least related to alohxi, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration site (burning, hardening, discomfort and soreness) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effect relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Dialysis studies have not been carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for alohemic overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mcg / m2 of microgram or 750 mcg of palonosetron were compared with patients who were given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strong treatment with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazron and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong chemical chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dagasetron were comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical examinations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of i.v. administered palleosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption after intravenous injection follows a gradual reduction of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportional to the overall dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once a daily intravenous dose of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was compared to 3 consecutive days total exposure (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to the value measured after a single intravenous dose; however, the cmax was 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which compared to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser degree, the isenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination of an intravenous dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron was found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an immutable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection in healthy volunteers, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal Eliminationshal value time and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron increase, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified by this.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies effects were observed only after expositions, which are considered sufficient to be considered sufficient over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 preclinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels involved in ventricular death and repolarization and prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily for more than two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumors, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low as for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) passed a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was approved by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug-effective ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease induced by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, liver tissue damage has occurred, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood have been abnormally elevated.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the medicine, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed in a way that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease again retarded in more patients than in the reference drug; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test used in the study to investigate the question of how far the drug uses an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug), is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected lains (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age the skin area should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin burns, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin wounds, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in treating abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body tissue) or from infections that have been detectable or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections exceed the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small lains, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd a permit for the launch of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment carefully blurred and appropriate alternative therapy of infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known or suspected as pathogen (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary infected wounds the efficacy of retinapiculin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deterioration of the infected area after a 2 or 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of retinapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected because of the low plasma concentrations found in humans after topical use on skin or infected surface wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the simultaneous oral administration of 2-times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the mean retinosine AUC (0-24) and cmax after topical application of 1% retinapamulin Salbe increased by 81% after topical application of healthy adult males.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical treatment in patients, dosages are not considered necessary if topical retinapiculin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral intake and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinapamulin Salbe should be applied during pregnancy only if a topical antibacterial treatment is clearly indicated and the application of retinapamulin is preferable to a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continues / stopped or the therapy continued with Altargo, it is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of Altargo therapy for the woman to weigh.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo have applied was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the administration site, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of operation Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits Peptidyltransfer, blocking partial P bindings and preventing normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be considered based on the local prevalence of resistance the use of retinapamiculin at least some infection forms, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the in-vitro activity of retinosglobulin compared to S.aureus were observed, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-contact with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and striped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice a day for 5 days of topical treatment of infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of humans after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 diced skin (cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660-times lower than the retinapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamiculin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with less participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity on rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis of genmutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats-microkernel test for in-vivo analysis chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 diced skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were noted.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1.8.1 of the application's application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of approval for placing on the market commits to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacoilance activities in pharmacovigilance plan as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in Module 1.8.2 of the application for authorisation, as well as all additional updates of the RMP agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted to the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have any irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area, you should finish the application of Altargo and speak to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it has not been prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is available in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure which contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Therefore, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and is ensured that the inoculation plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by aiding the immune system (the body's natural defense), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and creates antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix has the same components as the Vaccine of Twinrix Adult, which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997, and has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but twin children and twin children are administered as part of a vaccination plan existing from three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the use of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month and a 12-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.a. a permit for the transport of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The groundbreaking plan for primers with Ambirix is made up of two doses, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccines can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) are based on the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured, whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to a hepatitis-A- vaccine may need a vaccination vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and individuals with immune system disorders, under certain circumstances, there is no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies, so that in these cases the gift of further inoculation doses may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intracranial injection or intramuscular administration could result in suboptimal results, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, however, Ambirix can be injected without exception, since it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined measern- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune deficiency, it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, tenderness, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomer and preservative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines aged between 1 and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 up to and including 15 years, the tolerability of Ambirix was compared to that of the three-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturity on a calculation basis per Vaccine Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the application of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects compared to 39,1% in the subjects according to the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects who had received Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of valence was comparable high per proband (i.e. across the whole vaccine life of 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maturity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines who reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccination with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccination with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- antibodies form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the conversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were obtained with a standard combination of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was selectable, the rates of seroprotection (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3-canned impetus significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses reported in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11-year-olds a month after completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the inoculations received either a 2-doses-vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses-vaccine with a combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of form-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years of primers, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed following vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form-inactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study in 12- to including 15-year-olds it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hGH antibodies is comparable to 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months-vaccination scheme compared to that in the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may require a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect from infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both inoculate doses (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following a hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any ingredient of this vaccine, including neomycin, an antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest itself by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. if you / your child has already occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier inoculation against hepatitis A or hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly protect against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prescribed dose of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a form-inactivated Hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second dose of this vaccine with reduced amount of effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection against completion of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected under the skin and not in the muscles with people suffering from severe blood clotting disorders. if you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's defences, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis / undergoes.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is to vaccination.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking other medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / received or given immunoglobulins (antibodies) or has been planned or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, separate areas and as different limbs should be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, Ambirix will not be administered pregnant or nursing women unless it is urgent to be vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix's request inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data announced since the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix will remain positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in traffic only in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonites can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammoniemic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonites - split on several single doses to meals - swallowed, mixed with food or administered via a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since ammonites could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, i.e. without drug).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonites can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, headache, fainting, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The CHMP (CHMP) Committee concluded that ammonia effectively prevents high ammonia levels in patients suffering from the urea cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonites were permitted under "exceptional circumstances," because of the rarity of the disease at the time of the approval, only limited information on this medicine was submitted.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete lack of enzyme has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 life days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life) there is then an indication for the use when hyperammoniemic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for the growth and development of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose is sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifism deficiency in carbamylphosphate synthetase or Ornithindacrylambamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk to the origin of esophageal ulcera if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and edema associated with edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate is done over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in slowing neuronal proliferation and increased neuron loss.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate box, severe hypokalemia, cytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred during a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose limiting neurotoxicity for intravenous dosages of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound, which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenylbutyrate is produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the condition with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was earlier almost always infrusted, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through hemodialysis, the use of alternative pathways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (however, within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated prior to the first appearance of hyperammoniemic encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with time in many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the Ornithinkobamylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammoniemic encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are rarely reversible in treatment and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidney by glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis after individual delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous injection of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were measured 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycle disturbances or haemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20g / day) was no phenylacetate in the plasma after nightly fasting until the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of the liver, repeated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is secreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no conclusive effects in toxic and non-toxic cans (study 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is either taken orally (infants and children unable to swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrostomy or nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose is sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifism deficiency in carbamylphosphate synthetase or Ornithindacrylambamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, respectively 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When root flutes were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), lesions occurred in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate box, severe hypokalemia, cytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess liquid</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granule form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were measured 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this process, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot secrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are conducting laboratory tests, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">You may not take AMMONAPS during breastfeeding as the medicine can go over to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, disappearance of hearing, disorientation, memory problems and worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or contact your hospital for an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you miss the intake of AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS to the same single doses orally or via a gastric duct (hose that runs directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall) or a nasal probe (hose that is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped spoonful of granulate from the container. • Send a straight edge, e.g. a knife over the edge of the measuring spoon, to remove excess granules. • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon. • Remove the recommended number of measuring spoons from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood supply to heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "Stuplift" (an abnormal measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of Angiox was compared with common drugs or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">While PCI was often used as a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure), other medicines have been used to prevent blood clots, such as cantiximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revascularization) after 30 days or one year as effectively as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who had undergone a PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin in relation to all indicators, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalerudin, other milkworm, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and for a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd a permit for the placing of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous stimulus of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in another sequence, an additional strain of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An infusion of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous stimulus of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus-application of Angiox was not tested and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT amounts, the reconstituent and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the bolt dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivaliudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose is to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of the Bivalira-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the completion of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• eminent hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against milkhains • active bleedings or increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of the haemoglobin system and / or irreversible brain disturbances. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and acute bacterial Endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalira is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most arterial points occur in PCI-patients with arterial points, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment, in principle, bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalerudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Standards Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with Bivalira reaches the level existing prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulancia (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocytes aggregation inhibitor), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalerudin with platelet aggregation inhibitors or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaseology parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, unbinding or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalira alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalira plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalira-Group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding performed significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivaldrun plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point area, reducing the haemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleedings, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with Bivalira in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivaliruine Group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of undesirable events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following adverse events, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with a bivalent ooidine can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely monitored with regard to the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalira, a direct and specific thromboid inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and on the anion-binding region of thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombosis is bound in the liquid phase or on clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalerudin to thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible because Thrombin is slowly splitting the binding of Bivalerudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalerudin with serum was not induced to induce platelet aggregation reaction (HIT / HITTS) in the past to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalerudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect which is covered by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patients, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bivalidin should be added and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST-lift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor before starting the angiography (at the time of randomization) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were evenly distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent an angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1- year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and clopid grel according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomized double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of Angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalira were evaluated in patients who have undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that bivaliuine as peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid levels with subsequent re-valorization of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination will take place in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a scheduled half-life time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day up to 4 weeks at an exposure up to 10-fold of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects following a longer-term physiological strain in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed following short-term exposure comparable to that in clinical application, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the ready-to-use solution 17 is not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose containers made of type 1 glass of 10 ml, sealed with butyl rubber stuffing and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminium.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a puncture of Angiox and slightly waved until everything has completely dissolved and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 5% glucosal solution to the injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml, to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml bivalira.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or can't handle insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot effectively devise insulin, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined by a reduction of 0.14% for insulin lisperes after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% at human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin sensitivity or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any changes in the effective strength, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zincdelayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dose or the abort of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycemia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that increase blood sugar and increase propensity to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, monogenic oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphs, salicylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the effect of sympatheolytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, guanethidine and reserpine may be the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is overstepping into human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not exceed the mother's milk, nor is it absorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable drugs known from clinical trials, grouped according to system organ classes and ordered after decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000); not known (frequency based on the available data is invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive hun- ger, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">A podystrophy is omitted to continuously change the injection point within the injection area, in which a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or treated by a doctor by intravenous injection of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucoagine injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral blood glucose (especially by skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous gait of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin modulisin the therapeutically relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose proportional to intake of a dose of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase in the glucose-lowering effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin euulisin has twice as fast acting as normal human insulin and achieves the full glucosamine effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postprandial glycaemic control is reached like with human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin sensitivity was given 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin sensitivity is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved as in a human normal insulin which is given 2 Mi- groats before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin pulse in addition 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) before beginning of the meal was given (Figure 1A) and in comparison to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin sensitivity in addition 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal in comparison with human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
