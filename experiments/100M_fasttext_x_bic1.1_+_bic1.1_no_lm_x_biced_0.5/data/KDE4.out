the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; this is easier to use .
further information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Hand@@ book to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; load settings to set up extensions .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click In &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools Cut . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of cr@@ ashes if present .
the module intake filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Resol@@ ver filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s up to date working directory on different types .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory at local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the specific@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of portra@@ ying ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in shifted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ tangle , whose surface is proportional to its size .
for &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can be easily identified when it is far down in the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; Unix command you can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ ble representation is a rec@@ tangle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ tangle , which is switched over view color mode , can either show depth for easy recognition of the depth of the ne@@ sting or the image of another file property , such as the name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ tangle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the surface area is to be used by subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles , and you can specify the relative position of the label in the rec@@ tangle .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps &apos;s performance algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ vis@@ in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always observed . frames are drawn to represent the inter@@ lac@@ ing of the entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the square is square .
as divi@@ ding the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done , the implementation remains to be left to the implementation . in this case , it is possible to divide the areas so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minimum surface area for an entry on the menu item View Vie@@ wing at Surface . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the picture gallery module , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a revol@@ ving field to set the number of mini@@ atures each line in the gallery .

in the dialog box , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub @-@ folders are to be included .
in the Save file in HTML @-@ File , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
with the inter@@ folder box , you can set up with a sli@@ der or a turning panel , up to which level the sub @-@ folders are included .
to copy the original images to the gallery , you will be able to copy whether the original pictures should be copied into the gallery .
using the comment text box , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion images in the gallery .
specify the color depth in the check box to set a different color depth for thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings can be found in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ pack ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ in Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ pack ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG exports and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; attempts to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides an entry to problems or desires . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ pack ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ pack ; learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ pack ; participate , is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start digi@@ pack ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . just enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your machine . here is the data ab@@ n@@ k stored . this path stays the same for all the image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ pack ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the pictures , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ pack ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed thereby . while brow@@ sing the folder , you get a progress indicator as shown below :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ately searches the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is in hidden file . this allows you to insert extra @-@ half &amp; digi@@ pack ; do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and taking this on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can also avoid using it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help raw camera support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ pack ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ pack ; work together .
modern digital cameras record through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nail images may not be seen or the output could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things on &amp; digi@@ pack ; is how easy it can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ pack ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost every way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it &apos;s much easier to add &amp; digi@@ pack ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes came in &amp; digi@@ pack itself .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode using F@@ 11 and C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and dro@@ pping images works everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , across the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame works only if this ind is displayed in the symbol view . what fields are displayed can you configure in the dialog of the Al@@ bian settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Tab or after the date the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Import images to scan . you can also add a scre@@ enshot directly to an album .
to copy or post@@ p@@ one an album from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to collect information about this collection . to access the album features , right @-@ click on the album and select the album features context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you is used to sort your photos when you select collection from the tool@@ bar or select View albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums . sort by date .
buttons elder , average , ne@@ sts : these put the date on one of the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . for this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first image in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As a album preview , select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections can &apos;t be recycled .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of key@@ word for individual photos in the area My key@@ word list left down in the main window . album collections always have a different effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window . each photo will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album the first time , you have to wait briefly while thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using all preview images in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the respective preview . what information this is , you can change settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; set up the albums page and custom@@ ize the preview images to your specifications .
the preview images have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor a moment over a picture , the help shows the most important features including all the key features of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all that comes with &amp; digi@@ pack ; works . albums and Tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that fits you . image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... select . in the Edit section , you &apos;ll find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . image Edi@@ ting allows you to view and modify your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ pack ; the functionality that you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata associated with the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . this will lose this information from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ pack ; delete it , it will be moved into the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; F@@ 8 image delete or delete if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My data sli@@ p@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ pack ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or a search .
when a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords in a logical way . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word li@@ st. key , so that you can easily find the key words you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the key words in the loss of the database are re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; digi@@ pack ; the images will be noticed .
you can add new key@@ word by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select New Key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this becomes the sub@@ title of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place it there . then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking with the right mouse button and edit key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and set it as a album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to use &amp; digi@@ pack ; s functionality with keywords to use , you first need to add your photos by key@@ word . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to tag along with a key@@ word , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; you can also click on the preview of the images and assign key@@ word from the context menu .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can get a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , it will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the item menu Rem@@ ove . the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a tim@@ elessly adjustable hi@@ sto@@ gram of the number of images per unit of time . a select frame can be moved over this hi@@ sto@@ gram . to select a time frame , simply click on the lower rec@@ tangle of the selection frame that gives the time unit . this will show all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dates and in the future even more .
in the search box , a small lamp is the green when the search finds hits . if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bino@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you will get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filter what you entered as a search criteri@@ on .
if you are happy with your selection , press the head OK and the search is performed . the results are displayed in the view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its contex@@ tual menu .
when you select search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select as advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select search in the context menu Search .
the Advanced search creates an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . all rules are displayed line @-@ wise , separated by operators . one option can be added with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond to each other . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar . if you move a picture from somewhere above the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it down there .
sket@@ ch : free hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ pack ; finds the right images . also here , a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble fruit program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ cache .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To add the lumin@@ ous table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window are , you can open the illuminated table with L extras illumin@@ ating table .
from the preview pane , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right range of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to synchron@@ ise preview from the tool@@ bar and perform a Zoo or dep@@ ortation operations on one of the pictures , then you can compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly sort out from a series of images . if you navigate from the tool@@ bar , the two first images will automatically be loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . now , use the left mouse button at any thumb@@ nail to see it in the left @-@ hand side . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting desk like F@@ 4 file ...
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to connect visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section , you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you must click on these and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , then both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the Zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the mo@@ de@@ word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the picture was taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photographs capture , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a map and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and re @-@ use pictures . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , evaluate , appro@@ ve , archive , optimize , wait and export picture files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , conf@@ uses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is stored according to your definition , providing information about or docum@@ enting other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to take a certain photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ pack ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and in image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you care about anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files need to be organized somehow on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time .
you might be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location , unless you were in one year on the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; Export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work processes , constant flow of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes stac@@ king processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
we also recommend saving the metadata option in &amp; digi@@ pack &apos;s settings page . it ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change them ? added &amp; digi@@ pack ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should now assign key@@ word , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at the next work .
let us now use keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs , or Categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ pack ; automatically build the tree for you or add the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed key@@ word will be done by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while the sub@@ woo@@ fers are tra@@ cked .
this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section covers cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it more closely , you will be able to see some details , people , the place .
and now I am telling you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach quot ; in the Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . w@@ ow ! you start to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who consider your photos the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can store as much text , in an internation@@ alised alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as a label . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images to web galleries , then these cap@@ tions will be exported to your specifications in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ ol@@ ocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually perform your travel through images with ge@@ ographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights , to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the decor page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the working title of the photographer . examples of this may be the title as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider box to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to popul@@ ate the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can do this , in the picture embedded metadata , delete or change . for private individuals this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ pack ; in the near future it will provide such a module for stac@@ king processing .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are dealing with issues of the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled carefully and you can &apos;t trust them for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .
75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age due to chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ ex@@ propri@@ ated format . please read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it in a clean , dark dry and protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s preferences include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : disk failures
shortly : discs hold the longest when they are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature levels , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MAR@@ T may fail to determine the im@@ min@@ ent failure .
this is only the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not matter much , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause dist@@ orted key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed Mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip . however , remember that not every plug bar also contains a over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected by over@@ voltage . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also have a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it may therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to the protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system in order . if you buy an U@@ PS then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk exposure to your computer system and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software .
however , compared to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are gener@@ alized to photos . your free memory is available to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures available in full resolution online . the professional version provides you with unlimited storage , which should only be verified in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol , and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed memory in the offer .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs secure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain und@@ et@@ ected until you open a photo one day . it &apos;s quite distur@@ bing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a G@@ PL in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available .
Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebooks and 46 % on work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Rei@@ ser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not fully saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras include 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 meg@@ apixel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteri@@ or@@ ated . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard disk you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anyone else for data loss . so , make sure your data is affected by data loss every year . so backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change@@ over of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will strike you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane dies : fire , water , electricity , children and ste@@ els are dangerous enough to your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
thus des@@ aster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save it one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the one of the complete safegu@@ ards and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this approach gives you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work@@ files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , associated XMP files , original content , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be noted :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to take care of everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate it over time . unfortunately , there is no other way than to for@@ ge a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .

open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can be much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports XMP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG can use gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved colour assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open picture format developed by Adobe Systems . DNG was developed due to the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on TIFF / EP format and obli@@ ges to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already makes DNG available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it some@@ time .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based XMP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; proprietary metadata Plat@@ form@@ osa ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of their recording , mostly in raw format . XMP fits in as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , there can be problems when linking the metadata end@@ at@@ ei and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format can grow . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide @-@ ranging acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edit , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ layer editing you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images back with &amp; digi@@ master , then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , en@@ code in m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ pack ; in the section Add a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ at@@ enbank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera off to the display mode and turn it on . another description for this can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished -@@ indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page strings properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file features and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab Metad@@ ata shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS , etc. of the picture . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking on the Download button and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the requested ones with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button to download and then download the selected .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ pack until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are using the All or S@@ elected Un@@ select buttons , a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ pack ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete a few , you must select them first and then delete the selected delete .
note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos have been downloaded successfully into a &amp; digi@@ plug ; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do this via the camera file as this is much faster .
cameras often don &apos;t use especially meaningful names as fil@@ en@@ ames . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you upload photos from different shooting galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and file @-@ based sub@@ directories . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the standard car identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file names , you have the possibility to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading , or in upper@@ case if you prefer .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically once you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; can use all the information about the camera &apos;s orientation at the time point of recording . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , you can use the image in its original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ pack ; this is used to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album while downloading . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar Met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually disabled , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ pack ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog box &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that should be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection has been completed , you wonder where the images should be up@@ loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and latitude and which can be indicated on a map . data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it is interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser with a click , which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to carry out the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , seat and card references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . there are at least three ways to achieve this .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ it tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als associated with map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; try to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to choose to set up the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . to access these settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on Embedded Pre@@ view or Edit image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ pack ; note if you click on an entry in the main window .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright @-@ related data . this data is automatically written into the relevant IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even in case of database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should include the professional name of the photographer . this can be expressions such as employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency that provides the image should be enum@@ er@@ ated here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the data base of &amp; digi@@ pack ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ pack ; imported without being lost .
image descriptions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the in@@ scrip@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse cur@@ sor jumps over a file in the main window . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ pack ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ pack ; to view , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lamp by &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the lumin@@ ous table these settings are turned on if possible . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size , you should only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better picture results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar when you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing this picture can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling means that images are en@@ coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with the setting of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
using the TIFF command option , you can comp@@ ress the Def@@ late compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it has no effect on picture quality since the Def@@ late algorithm is los@@ s@@ less .
with the los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ pack ; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present it evol@@ ves very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixel on odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . this option distingu@@ ishes the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G- or the A@@ HD quality method .
if set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this option is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top positions in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed light , so the parts of your images that are burned into , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as a continuous white . the setting colors will generate some unusual results as they show the pointed lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to re@@ build some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ akers .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you will get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 , but this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; -@@ image processing . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which is a matrix colored pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ei@@ ty @-@ Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the colour devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , since it is performed during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given back . there is also L@@ CM and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the colour information from one colour space in the other is translated to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image opens in image editing / Start color management module with raw files .
color Profile folder contain the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ pack ; then examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC Pro@@ files You have the possibility here &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when the raw file is opened .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should be compatible with the camera creator and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or gam@@ ma@@ correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate how your image would be re@@ produced from one device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be correct , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious which color profile is provided for what it is intended for . unfortunately not with the models from Canon . hence , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon Profile Extension lets you recognize the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for Land@@ sc@@ apes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; picture viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ pack can support ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds is good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the ad .
on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image mode . currently , here are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B- and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have chosen a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera bar . you must specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / F3 , where you can mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ pack ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer you can set the discussion of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without quer@@ ying . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also display the &amp; digi@@ kam a welcome screen ; to supp@@ ress when starting . this will possibly speed up the start process of &amp; digi@@ pack ; .
the Start Rec@@ ording Start for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ pack ; search the base folder for new or deleted records / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ pack ; if something was deleted from the base folder , you asked if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ pack ; to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ pack , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; contains a quick image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry ad / editing .
image Edi@@ ting contains a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ pack ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , displaying the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image editing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you cannot restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with file Save as .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore or button Un@@ Rest@@ ore the image processing button to restore in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last saving .
virtually any image processing action can be und@@ one or rever@@ ted . the last action can undo you by editing , res@@ etting , res@@ etting , selecting Edit from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z for undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift key to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you started the image editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ large factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can change this in the settings dialog from &amp; digi@@ pack ; you can view this from the &amp; digi@@ pack ; view the panel for setting the image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File menu print and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can custom@@ ize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print super@@ visor from the menu album Export . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear and disappear again .
in the labelling view , you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note the comment below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ h@@ aped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should note these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the button users or simply switch to the next image , the let@@ tering will then be saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and gra@@ dations . it can be applied either with a single mou@@ sec@@ lick on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the en@@ coding follows the sch@@ ema in the table below :
the key@@ word display shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box which previously used in this &amp; digi@@ kam ; session used keywords .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the given key@@ word . you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when typ@@ ing keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the whole selection .
the key@@ word word@@ filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views . if one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the inter@@ section of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop key words . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and place it on the selection . then , a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the key@@ word .
in the example above , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is fixed to No Key@@ words , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree was drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be or should be , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control section .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an advanced search through all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner can have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that are the colors that you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic comes to color management then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at each point of the image processing work@@ flows . the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management .
if your workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and therefore need to think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limits compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to calli@@ per my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut or not , you have to calli@@ gra@@ ze your monitor , since s@@ RGB makes the circle . when you work as in the s@@ RGB color space , you either need to calli@@ gra@@ ze your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , compensate , Automatic shut and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rig@@ ate Automatic Cor@@ rection are automatically trying to make the best out of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the fix@@ ture values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot will be as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
lev@@ elling : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ osity coefficient of the colors of the selected image , so that the hi@@ sto@@ gram of the intensity can be as flat as possible . sometimes the same produces very good results when improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic lev@@ elling : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the entire history area .
bro@@ aden contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited because there is a color space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright algorithms of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ron@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynam@@ ically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original whit@@ el@@ ab again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
this hi@@ sto@@ gram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels can have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button , you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your score depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play the stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then click on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance that you have set you can save to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button re@@ stores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also give another photo as your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the coding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit en@@ coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as used for editing raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for brightness . a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu under colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to store multiple color channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool to gra@@ dation that you can find gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ pack ; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the colored , dar@@ ker areas shel@@ tered the sensitive photo paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas were dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment eventually creates a negative image that so does not produce on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simply , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can click to preview the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you are applied .
if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all changes you perform can be viewed in preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool can be used to improve the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the sli@@ der for the purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hi@@ sto@@ gram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hi@@ sto@@ gram , an active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the picture and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and watch out how the image changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image . on the left side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hi@@ sto@@ gram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear representation is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively change the output values as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded again later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
when you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the option over@@ exposed indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it is not an effect to see the final outcome .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module :
next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most sensible . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a curve part to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and that the associated image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marker is visible . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line appears on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and Load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves .
the over@@ exposed indicators option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it is not an effect to see the final outcome .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Canal . shadow and sun shades have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mix@@ ers of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hi@@ sto@@ gram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be seen for comparison with the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hi@@ sto@@ gram to show you the respective color value .
the controls for the module are down@@ right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel Mixer is the tool for generating magnificent black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color becomes a visible sound that comes from colour@@ less . far@@ rowing consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion in which you reduce the colour first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the option over@@ exposed indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it is not an effect to see the final outcome .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . preserving the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the modified image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film rolling profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate moon light scenes at day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ pe : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold to the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of remaining a pressure and re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ ph@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlar@@ ging points or how a mur@@ al on a wall . the menu entry Picture texture applying the image processing can be used for it .
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for sc@@ attering eye . to add frame the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , you enter the desired frame type for your picture . passing through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce circum@@ fer@@ des it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , it surro@@ unds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is from 1 % to 50 % limited .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . the bigger the picture , the bigger the character set must be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting that you selected for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
apply with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply tool Tem@@ plate to put a sten@@ cil on a picture .
apply the Menu Picture Tem@@ plate in image processing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation . however , you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; please send an email to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Mail@@ ing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you will need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button root folder in dialog . select the folder in which you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
once the root folder has been set for st@@ encils , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template of templates automatically .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inking : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically be adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the digit@@ alization process needs to summar@@ ize colors with only minimal differences to a col@@ oring point . this in turn causes sharp edges a little bl@@ ur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images a camera is often applied to internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format on the other hand must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a focus filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control over your image .
in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate Follow Focus .
you should deal with this carefully , since the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image the tool re@@ focus . under re@@ focusing , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft@@ ening with the menu item Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount intensi@@ fies the effect . if you make the un@@ sharpen@@ ed mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will generate near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a ridge . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should better shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the im@@ pregn@@ ated picture , which is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . by this you can define a minimum difference in order for a edge of the filter to be applied . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharp@@ ness and therefore beauty defects in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the picture . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than bl@@ ur@@ red m@@ asked . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to this the mathematical result also from the source pixels , which are far from the original source pixel . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese in@@ verse of the auss &apos;s folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels , causing unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should give 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your picture is bl@@ ur@@ red then should pay attention to hal@@ o notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 , the image quality is very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the g@@ auss &apos;s edge . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is authentic . in most cases you should leave this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you chose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally Un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better outcomes than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a bigger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . the result of the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ clear color image needs to be corrected . this picture has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the Smo@@ ked knob sets the sharp@@ ness of the range of di@@ mm@@ ed in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows an adjusted colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab@@ s smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values mainly fl@@ atten out homo@@ geneous regions and leave details sharply . a value of 0.9 should maintain details in such a way that no sharp@@ ness should be subsequently subordin@@ ated .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly across all directions , while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ular@@ ity or CCD noise , a high value will generate wav@@ eli@@ ke patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts will be removed best at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ . p then defines relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ b@@ ular effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repe@@ ats : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 is enough .
angle of angle there &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . be aware that small angles create a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integ@@ rale stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 .
using linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you get by selecting this option is only small , but it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend it to leave it out .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can her@@ eby be stored in a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ down .
the module will be applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a bad film shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about digital cameras from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny sound that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window Details and the Advanced Settings dialog can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller flaws .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing from the filter towards the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubri@@ cation will occur again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend you either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ bit tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically rough@@ ened more strongly . however , it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter@@ ing . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear at the edges .
store below and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool for soft@@ ening with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate soft and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film production , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local faults that emerge in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ s and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm he produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in the un@@ compressed image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can her@@ eby be stored in a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ ering .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction . the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera onto a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ dation on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) to see .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo which was read by a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photographic paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows to remove Hot@@ pixels from photos with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in supp@@ ress for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wiz@@ ard with the Button Creator . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels using CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels . note that the wiz@@ ard re@@ members the final dark image and will automatically re@@ charge it in the next session .
the image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image . preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the faul@@ ty pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line for a one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faul@@ ty pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of quadra@@ tic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to comp@@ ute a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic ben@@ ds ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faul@@ ty pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a faul@@ ty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , a picture .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ s@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ady ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has draw@@ backs . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which may increase the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects are created by motion .
with the large expos@@ ing area of today &apos;s film and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a Cent@@ er@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a rough image that has been made without this filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction uses the transformation with a Cent@@ er@@ filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing a picture with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , because you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fine re @-@ adjustment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation out of the color gra@@ dation ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a den@@ ial and contrast correction was also performed in the image using this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion of the fourth degree . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Paramet@@ ers &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and performs a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the correction of distortion . the values that you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the tone or kis@@ sing @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . best , perform this correction first . if you want to cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the picture preview to show the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the tone / kis@@ sing @-@ shaped distortion with the help of the lines .
if you recti@@ fy a kis@@ sing distortion , the resulting picture will have black edges . you can remove these with the trimm@@ ing tool in the menu Trans@@ Cut cro@@ pping from the image processing or via the zoom control of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , such as pictures from the front , frame and painting , is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera manually you will always have a slight distortion from the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate inf@@ ra @-@ red film from G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left @-@ hand side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for fil@@ ming and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . turn on the option Add film gra@@ dation when you want to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of fil@@ ming and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mix@@ es color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos since the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of au@@ ra in the top .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter fil@@ ming is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gra@@ dation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film licensing phenomenon gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome pictures , you need to use this filter .
the controller can cali@@ br@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is set to ISO @-@ 2400 though often higher values are required . if you still need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the fil@@ ming effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ ing controls the smooth@@ ing or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch you .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engra@@ ver shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engra@@ ver is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing about the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ stro@@ us landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to wave blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
this filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur@@ red effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ gh@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ ity : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels at a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance un@@ sharpen@@ ing : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing from a car or train , camera .
soft@@ ening bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image soft@@ ly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ or photos or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ ring the image by random displacement of the pixels and simul@@ ates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of an invol@@ un@@ tary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ ity : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes this without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photograph into rectangular cells and then creates it , through the col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a proprietary algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows changing the size of drops . since the size of the image does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can hold with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , i.e. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops of filters . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the mach@@ ined image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can do it by mir@@ r@@ oring or turning into the right direction . the tools for this can be found in the Transform@@ ieren Dre@@ aming and Trans@@ forming mirrors .
infl@@ ating a photo is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to draw the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm image infl@@ ating was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ b@@ ular effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and load are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ all@@ ying for picture enlar@@ ges can be saved as a text file and then loaded again later .
infl@@ ating a photo is very fast at what it does , but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ yond .
you can see below an example of photo bub@@ bles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse just the rec@@ tangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and re@@ trac@@ ting the rec@@ tangle . you will then see this rec@@ tangle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rec@@ tangle .
once you are satisfied with cutting , use the button The cutting knob of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimm@@ ed ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rec@@ tangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool Fol@@ ding aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of height and width is always assigned to the width .
cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you &apos;re using centi@@ meters , inches , or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below in the dialog , you can set the area to cut to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image .
the setup help settings let you f@@ ade in , so that you can put your pictures together better . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ thirds rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rec@@ tangle with similar harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that relies on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us mus@@ sel or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful .
the golden partition is the Ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you were already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and py@@ rami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden sharing in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 and etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos to your goal . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that the eye drops at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the gold spiral . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the pages of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diagonal on these lines can be placed a static object more dynam@@ ically .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options Horizont@@ al mirror and flip vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious parti@@ tions .
with the button color you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo then it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is auto @-@ cutting function . choose one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation . please note the warning above .
all perspective trans@@ formations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
at the left corner : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
at the right corner : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
at the left corner : indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
at the right corner : indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little bit dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal bra@@ cing , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not rotation , the picture is dist@@ orted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
switch your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the s@@ ling tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture is wi@@ ped out a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ ear@@ ings generate twice as much s@@ wis@@ s and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has un@@ attractive tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries , it is impossible to make a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ pack ; displays only files in formats that you know . this is done with the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ pack ; the file in image processing will change . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section , you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ pack ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression techniques on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to know more about the raw image format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF using the body image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the configuration section , you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ pack ; with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that came from &amp; digi@@ pack ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ pack ; however , is no film editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit movies . if you click on a film file &amp; digi@@ pack ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use to start the program to play .

many tools you need to do the photo editing in &amp; digi@@ pack ; contain . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , im@@ perfec@@ tions , etc ; . use a single dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture apply ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divided without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower part shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to display over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble fruit program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ etten files installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal Fol@@ ders for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the Palette Editor , you can select from a list of the installed pallets , or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette view . here the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box In C@@ urs@@ or is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing was selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a new@@ line character if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and find them in the color selection on the left side .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Graph@@ ene . the graphic programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program , which &amp; graphic ; contains , are out@@ dated according to the program author ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated and k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphic ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graphic ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; shows graph with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph@@ ene in &amp; kate ; the graph@@ ene is newly calculated and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; kate ; open or open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in one &amp; kate ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to represent more than these knot@@ s )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graph@@ s pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom scre@@ enshot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner if the diagram is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file currently loaded in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window is displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; to use it , see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance open , eg ; in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance or want to show the graph to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the previous option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split to multiple sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come to a page , should be adjusted to this page . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is open outside a current session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph@@ s in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or determine at each start to be asked .
the context menu , which normally appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphic ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directional graph@@ s . the algorithm gives the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges of edges as possible .
der &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces presentations in accordance with the boun@@ ce spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring@@ - spring model for un@@ eri@@ fied graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tic , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .

the K@@ IP@@ I module loading images provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the s@@ ane project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and s@@ ane installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . choose the source of which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s default values to select your image accordingly . look at the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button scan . the estimated fil@@ es@@ ize will be displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , otherwise some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the button scan , you must wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the image file appears . please remember that the type BMP does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be saved .
scre@@ en@@ shots can be created after you have selected the Edit &gt; Screen Saver menu . a window appears in which you can set up the various screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window beneath the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete work area , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other desktop , you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the scre@@ enshot is made , the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above .

the module exp@@ orting to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a to@@ ken . this is used for your authentication . so it is practically your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send pictures to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after clicking Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exp@@ ires to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that display the module . you will also need any other auth@@ oriz@@ ations to upload . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as Tags during the upload .
with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lies you can set the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the pictures . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery export has no documentation at this time . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to be added and edited in the metadata of an image . ge@@ ographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the location can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization module provides tools to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and latitude are used here .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with G@@ PX file . of course , this file contains data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed using the coordinates in red . GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera level must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the maximum time devi@@ ation setting indicates a higher devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera level . if the devi@@ ation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relations to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog box coordinates the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Run this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages con@@ form to 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ bian preview and the text appearing in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; D@@ exter@@ ity Show , displayed
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub @-@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you select the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nail image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press C@@ anc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser is automatically started to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I view viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as fil@@ ming , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and m@@ aus@@ ages . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after startup , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses in quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Digital Camera Client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the picture you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at Ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module , it is possible to create the DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD formats for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images to be packed in the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG slide show .
the images you have selected are then listed in the image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates a very sudden , a high , however , very smooth picture changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it go black . you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as much as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the movie with the button code . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a critic appears that co@@ den@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings on the right below .
the print wiz@@ ard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo frames . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or PP@@ M .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quot@@ ation of it is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software of your camera creator . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to convert and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged Image format , TIFF , re@@ tains all information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later to use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before wor@@ sen@@ ing the image quality . TIFF and PP@@ M are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a file format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion by exec@@ uting button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode when you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image that is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful in case they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or enlarge the image . for this purpose , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the pictures you selected . you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog . a preview on the right @-@ hand side will be displayed for the last selected image .
you can also drag images to the list of images and place them in order to add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button remove images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachments .
do not take care to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail .
the PNG format under the Picture file format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted from los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ it data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages , on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end . you can close this window with the button closure .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have your slide show appear . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
the Open@@ GL Output option in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually termin@@ ate it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the individual pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , every transition between images sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and the next picture and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ sing , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries .
in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you click on the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see image .
if you select to select another person only the pictures shown on which both people are to be seen . through this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your domain .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail image , which is of course also valid for locations , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself .
to view images in addition to the names , select the button on the right outside of the tool@@ bar . in the appearing context menu , you can choose which view you need to use for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you will need to specify which image to be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and display the image editor in the context menu . here you can adjust the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
when you call the search in the main window , a dialog will show you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description field , the descriptions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all the images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here is shown by images , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manu@@ als , but prefer to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the scre@@ en@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog choose the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time start , or select the menu item k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try out the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try them .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip you can see here : . as the name says , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours , and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database , showing the bar only 10 minutes sections .
the tim@@ eline allows you to inter@@ actively use the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview screen ) and the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will view only images of this period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the one is included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the included in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built @-@ in version that you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created , which is to be seen on the overview page .
last but not least , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed which is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently , all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain ones .
in this section , you can determine how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page , you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a larger image , it switches to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to select a root folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE support protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , will be started . the URL you define here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to that . so the import function , see , properly works you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three related to base folders and UR@@ Ls . in these settings , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name can be set in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your pictures with them . however , if you have already spent a lot of time to record the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc , you do not have to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to the file in the file . the advantage of all images to be stored in the file is that you can share all images and share this file so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have given when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for export images is described , which can be accessed from the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
if you wish to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File File menu ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you specify the category persons of the file you imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named for your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked what categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture .
it just has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting up the information about your images , through ( 2 ) brow@@ sing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ album has started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal Backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and will automatically re@@ use them for future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / index@@ .x@@ ml .
the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... move to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , the various settings will be explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which allows you to access the F1 key and one click on the desired option for each setting .
it describes how you can define different properties for each picture , for example persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , e.g. objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left window of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug@@ in interface .
the modules can be called through the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can call via the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . that &apos;s why you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using this on your own pictures .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications put their pictures in albums : here is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules to make use of the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , is all images showing you the picture preview right now .
besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , we have to give the modules a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums . so if you use the category persons for example , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window that you can browse your image database . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can either use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , shown on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures are taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and brow@@ sing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists using a text box by typ@@ ing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to move the pictures within the list : for example , if you have a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by moving the names used up , find people quicker and assigned .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date below the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add comments . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the thumb@@ nail of the picture on the upper right .
if you have added several images , e.g. with the same person , it may be more convenient to mark all of these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also drag an entry into a category and place it there to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . note , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ otation dialog by clicking and moving the strip , which form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... which offers you , among other things , the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and hide / hide windows here . see the picture in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have not set any filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply clicking the mouse button with the middle mouse button . just try .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer yet , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the removal button or select the Edit menu in the Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the image .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use pictures without saving you on the hard disk . of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive . however , for pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance , such as the confusion of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the Menu Picture , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little bit more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible for others and click Current View lock in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can also view all the images that your little sister may see , and lock the menu item Any@@ thing out of the current view .
with this you have specified which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images shut , so that all images you have blocked are hidden . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered for unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the privacy menu .
please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can access the password as un@@ encrypted text , or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to retri@@ eve the view on private pictures .
the reason you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all information you have to enter via the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the info box on the top of the picture you want to see , you can drag it with the mouse and put somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you the right entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
when several images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be checked by pressing the C@@ trl key and Plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
if you are using the viewer , you can zoom in and zoom into the image . for zo@@ oming , you can simply pull out a rec@@ tangle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom out again . the Plus @-@ key zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rec@@ tangle is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oming .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the mouse button , zoom is set , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot have to put on the picture . at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you might prefer to select only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while watching them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in the picture you can see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , they are available in your browser . so if you have any images that you edit , print or whatever is selected , simply mark them all at once with notes . this is described in . then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you can display categories in the previous preview , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature once the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the painting is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in order to disable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the image from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; you must not fully control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have read and understood .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the sub@@ property of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the tool@@ bar icon or select a menu entry in the Insert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ e@@ tion either from the menu bar to edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input error and click Apply , or disc@@ ard the changes with ab@@ ort .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with the help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub @-@ order item . if you only want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross local .
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can ri@@ ght@@ click these control points and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected , or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage of the scene selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tangle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , pull the starter on the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing to the left in the hat@@ ch bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the tap bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view you can save with view window order ... save . it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 up @-@ to @-@ date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; version 1.0 does not support .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering Symbol Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the Tool@@ bar or select the menu item View scene .
a render mode meets the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu ... the following dialog is opened :
each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box under section and specify the image cut to render into the input fields .
in the Com@@ bin@@ ation field quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection illumination . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures look better with this property .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the ad@@ joining pixels with reference . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is separated again and again and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be charged extra points , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the defined threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and tested for further sub@@ division . you can set the maximum depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ Con@@ sole output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import scene , select the menu item File Imp@@ orting ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when import@@ ing , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; a scene ren@@ ames . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
click help in property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( e.g. al@@ tim@@ etry data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tangle for the field of view in camera view and in the window @-@ type plates .
you can set the object scope of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turning .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed items , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , e.g. the sphere , you can set the detail step separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail accuracy for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is shown in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the smooth@@ ing effect , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used to rendering scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . section window orders will explain how to create and store window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation Panel Standard Window Order : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ remo@@ ver ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views with the button removal .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right @-@ hand side of the existing window , with un@@ ts anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , holding a map sheet view in common with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on a level .
but you should carefully consider the warnings that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed all error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the following default window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wi@@ re@@ model view shows how the camera looks at the entire scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation too &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the button Apply or press En@@ ter , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might insert a header ( insert the final body header ) and set the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button Apply or En@@ ter . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but in the moment you choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ property . the pig@@ ment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , preview of the pig@@ ment shows only a matt black material , because you have to enter settings for the pig@@ ment yet . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time by clicking on thumb@@ nail . now , there are many possibilities again , but now take the simpl@@ est .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in preview , click the Apply button and then call the preview button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you are now rendering your picture with a click on the symbol , you should receive the following result :
in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the object tree you have to enter the entry color list . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to run this step simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the ball can be as simple as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the button or the button users ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise the ball would float above the ground , since you moved the bottom to a unit down@@ wards .
of course rendering is now a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color :
select first sub@@ property and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , then choose one @-@ colored and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following scre@@ en@@ shots and click Apply , or press En@@ ter .
the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrom@@ ed surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling it offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer moves hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam will affect the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene that is supposed to be rendered is some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and memory space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last rever@@ ted command . this menu entry can only be selected when you have used Edit reverse .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change key short@@ cuts . you can use this option to set default short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre @-@ apply rough surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base , by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or full@@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists any files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n , or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog Con@@ figuration - &amp; Coo@@ king Show ; there are five map cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; in the two others , short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for each window .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , load &amp; watch show ; already the next picture in the folder while you are still viewing the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slideshow .
save the name of the recently opened folder with this option . at the next start , the game will open and watch the folder in the browser window .
click on the coloured bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; watch show ; set up so that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determine if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ peti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is ab@@ orted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of work of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays big icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor is related to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor is related to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ il@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .

&amp; show photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ photo ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users here . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to join &amp; show photo ; participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instruction to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show photo ; try to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . to access these settings , you need to select the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; to access these settings , you need to select the settings dialog in eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposed indicator has been selected . the colors with what you are supposed to display should be in contrast . exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure .
the main window of the show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see the same page bar in image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer power to scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images that no longer do as images and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the store .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog is opened to select the scanner .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom to fit the entire thumb@@ nail into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings is selected , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be stored and sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button will open the dialogue of the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to save images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; it should automatically be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical suff@@ ix that is automatically counted when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts the K@@ DE Hilfe with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE via -@@ Dialog box for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

below , you can set up a list of these ab@@ brevi@@ ations and their function . the global short@@ cut can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting Global Access@@ key ... selecting the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... select .
you may possibly set up existing multimedia keys to function as a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ list browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de . additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use this dialog , so the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands to run . to do this , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ er@@ ts to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ sts the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script itself has to take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information on the new piece ( for example , the metadata or unit length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Menu@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ix paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected play@@ list files when a user @-@ defined menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) to remove the menu .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user sends a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the Signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , to do cleaning work . this includes , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which optionally can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . so the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file &apos;s rights :
if your script package is ready , you can load it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the W@@ iki template site of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the play@@ list instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just looking for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting Browser and quick search you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used so that THE@@ Y can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to rel@@ ive your music !
typically , you have to enter the following in the root folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options you can enable or disable at compile @-@ time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies need to be satisfied so that they can be used .
activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several maps for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the Player window , the player window will switch to the play@@ list in addition to the play@@ list . if the option is off , only the play@@ list window ( Ju@@ K ) will be displayed .
use V@@ oting Bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option turns on the experimental function of the V@@ oting Bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this modi@@ fies the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
place mood files at the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the preferences folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ( typically ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above .
save play@@ list to exit , save the current play@@ list automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the play@@ list , will use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date piece visible when changing the pieces means that the play@@ list window will roll up / down to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing the context browser , the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next item is being played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance App@@ ear@@ ance , you can adjust the appearance of Amar@@ ok . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can use the otherwise gray colored section . you can choose fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ list window , player window and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you yourself have the qu@@ al of your choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector for foreg@@ round and background color to be activated .
res@@ ume playback causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will continue automatically with the piece where it has been stopped at the last stop .
the on @-@ screen display allows you to set up the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be rendered in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to custom@@ ize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multi @-@ screen environment to appear on the O@@ SD .
the map audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable even more settings in this map .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected and their sub @-@ folders will search for music .
monitor Chan@@ ges : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ list browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ation Panel driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further configuration is needed in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l unit section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . among machines : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , a network port is typ@@ ed under which the database is available . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m raises support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
sending played pieces and updating the profile : this setting enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ en@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the pack@@ et k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs it contains , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find , for example , modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and re @-@ create the collection .
most of the time it is due to the fact that Tag@@ lib is crashing when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is slightly more mature .
ensure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to pl@@ unge when editing the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re @-@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / re@@ play / dynamic play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ k@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ k@@ app : Un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ co@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are resolved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also help other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C below ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error there if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of Amar@@ ok , only an empty play@@ list appears . how do music pieces enter there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the play@@ list . click on the title bar of the play@@ list and select column Display rating . click anywhere in the new rating column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From play@@ list to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list and drop it there just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as : - )
in the play@@ list tool@@ bar , right next to the Add button , you &apos;ll find the Play@@ list button . click on it .
you probably don &apos;t have the program x@@ mms @-@ config . install the x@@ mms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual too , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be : what media types does G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support almost every conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may be ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which does not include any MP3 decoder in default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , En@@ ter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia &apos; Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays mp3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously pass audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of problems and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e. g . shock sink ) .
do not forget that media need to be de@@ coded first . you can &apos;t simply send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d only want to listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people when you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ rc can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver , but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
you probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts @-@ Bu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ amy the visu@@ alis@@ ations react . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( exit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run Start@@ Servers , once as a system administrator and once as your regular user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer Module folder and run it again . run now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by Br@@ its Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
this is already possible thanks to D@@ CO@@ P . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped prior to bed .
how to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you an interpre@@ ter and title of the running piece from : ss@@ h -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ v.@@ d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . to do this , press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing En@@ ter key after a search in the play@@ list , the first search result will be played and the search returned .

my Personal Fol@@ ders $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created , and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ oks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on audio CD in the menu . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag it to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic en@@ coding , use mp3 or og@@ g files instead .

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a decl@@ ining value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual score has on the overall result .
you can apply the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ list window . then select the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the item and editing : select comment or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog metadata .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not to be brought together with Amar@@ ok &apos;s scheduled plan .

if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore a lot of error reports .
probably got &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I have installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
if G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install it again .

the play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the play@@ list , such as the context browser . on the right @-@ hand side is the play@@ list itself . the play@@ list is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays different information about the current piece . its appearance can be adapted using context browser design . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub @-@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window starts off . the information shown there has now been distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . additionally , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first part in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
below the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find further information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover pictures in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the suggested pieces are the favor@@ ites of this interpre@@ ter . this area displays the five highest scores of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last area , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button , and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the play@@ list from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required for this purpose .
the button Search opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to artist , and below is another split according to the respective album . if you want to see combinations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Ass@@ orted by artist and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown to an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically with each other . the interpre@@ ter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , it might take a while .
a search filter is located directly beneath the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . please refer to the play@@ list section in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time frames , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . you can also , of course , select your overall collection , whereby the filter is practically disabled .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you get the following options .
load - This empty the current play@@ list and inserts the selected pieces in the current order in the playback .
attach to play@@ list - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current play@@ list . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function will add the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will play you next .
save as play@@ list ... - Save the selected pieces as a play@@ list . you will be asked for a name to save the list .
transfer to media player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queu@@ e for transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser .
all pieces of this interpre@@ ter will burn / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not shown .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
( N ) Mo@@ ve files in the bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among various interpre@@ ters .
highlight the compilation marker - change the album marked as a compilation back to a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be displayed under various performers but under the corresponding artist .
the play@@ list browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ list browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a play@@ list with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Add Intelligent Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new play@@ list .
the sub@@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to use for example your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to artist sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the play@@ list and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click Apply . as a result , the pieces will be up@@ loaded to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and lo@@ osen the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick music from a given URL . if you enter e.g. tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop the music from there into the play@@ list .
if the play@@ list is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be tri@@ cky by simply drop down . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
the play@@ list contains all the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired location and drop . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all the pieces containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then choose the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries , which Mike Old@@ field contain , but not after entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : review : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key , and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the play@@ list &apos;s tool@@ bar is at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some of the play@@ list functions . on the left , you will find the Add to Add to the play@@ list .
next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the play@@ list .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlar@@ ging analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar menu is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration via this menu .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example , play control and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the most useful information about the play@@ list . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all the pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking double in the corresponding display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the option status bar in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the play@@ list .
a click on this entry opens the window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . you can select the Visu@@ alization of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry hi@@ des a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover pictures . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from :
the queu@@ e management gets your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function , you have even more control over the play@@ list . after you have set a piece into the queu@@ e , the play@@ list shows a number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a slice to the queu@@ e , select the item in the play@@ list and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the play@@ list . you can then change the order of the pieces in queu@@ e management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details for setting up these are later followed ) .
re@@ plen@@ ish your play@@ list with random pieces from your entire collection and add additional random pieces during playback .
adds Pi@@ eces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( previously : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ bb@@ ler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your play@@ list . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic play@@ list work .
double click on the play@@ list you want , drag it to the play@@ list window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select loading . that way , your current play@@ list will be replaced by the new play@@ list , so you should save the old play@@ list !
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill in your play@@ list and you can add at least one piece from your collection . the suggested pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection , so your play@@ list will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current play@@ list , enable the latest possible dynamic mode : setting Dynamic mode . this will use your existing play@@ list as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be disabled again .
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current play@@ list and adds new pieces in accordance with the dynamic mode . edit play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the play@@ list and you can change the settings .
with a right click on a dynamic play@@ list , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the play@@ list settings .
enter any name for the play@@ list here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your play@@ list will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be ski@@ pped and they will not double in this play@@ list . however , if the setting is active , the played tracks will be removed , taking heed to the settings being played .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the play@@ list . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the play@@ list after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the play@@ list will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one play@@ list , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have selected .
some scripts make your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by installing a script . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you no longer want to use a script , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to the Writ@@ ing scripts section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the check box next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . in order to understand the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will receive a lower quality when en@@ coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog box that looks like this or something like this :
in this dialog box , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the wid@@ get modules . to fix this problem launch q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is available at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback , access community help from the forums and learn about news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio coding technology and for handling audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG video decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
normal : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , you can make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces can be played differently according to each other .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the root folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog stores below will be displayed with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been changed and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each non @-@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file .
includes all opened projects and ended &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called File Sch@@ were .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the forth@@ coming dialog . this has the same effect as when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the root folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button Bren@@ nen , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? -@@ aid described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful when you put files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful for you rather than help so you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project .
open the CD copy dialog . this allows even without a project file to copy a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
open the DVD copy dialog . this allows even without a project file to copy a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also create only a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form .
open the dialogue to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content will be completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes Over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be fired inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , coding settings , and even ways to change the size and trim black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the content view and includes the properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view allows to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header does not have any real function , it looks only nicely and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the commands in the upper part , you can adjust the allocation of keys to the bottom .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function at first . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine @-@ adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script , for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functional scope , therefore your taste and type of your task is crucial to which the enclosed program will give you the default .
in this chapter , we assume that you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions common to all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects .
void cop@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Alternati@@ vely you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Folder ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String ) void Ad@@ Ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String ) void remo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ne@@ wn@@ ame ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Folder bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ select for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be audio CD ; s read and stored in MP3 or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ Data in wa@@ v files on the hard disk ) and by many co@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
will be compressed in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or even in other formats such as the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile something themselves . however , only the co@@ ders need to be installed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction on en@@ co@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoid protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done ( but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk explains . this ( hopefully ) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which en@@ coder programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything manually captured .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . by step by step for example , you will find further information about how this program is used , and screen shots showing descriptions of the regi@@ sters for configur@@ ing the program .
CD@@ DB asks the CD data according to the request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . )
start reading and - when a en@@ coder has been configured in the coding settings tab in the setup directory - en@@ coding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different en@@ coder than the standard . it must be noted that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read @-@ out file for coding is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as logs , sp@@ ades ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main initi@@ ation dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with various map cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting the en@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , en@@ co@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among audio formats that lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . og@@ g may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both en@@ co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos; not that &apos; free , l@@ ame is supplied free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to og@@ g slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play instruments is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rati@@ os for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a title . good enough for music from young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without considering the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or retri@@ eved by the software automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the co@@ ders explain the switch for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; Title to the keywords when MP@@ 3s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the -@@ tt and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button lab@@ eling in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information instead of entering it . it is to be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note the translation : with it the author is meant ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to specify a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b you can use another ( fake ) address used in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only be known by the progra@@ mmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more exactly , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading the audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
to save the removed WAV files , the en@@ coder and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the en@@ coder . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the en@@ coder package needs to be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coding , further information can be obtained via its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this may have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read rights on it and if both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio en@@ coder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; to read out . check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t succeed !
there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 key words ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , since it is considered not totally free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for any reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the en@@ coder to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , let &apos;s share the program with , the fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them with any reading of a &amp; CD ; change when the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can be accessed , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map card General settings . there is not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left as left / entered as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
please select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when data to create keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the map CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down box is simpler , becomes a &amp; CD ; record found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , please keep in mind that if you want to enter all manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set up on the following map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB servers : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will function as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , but because many fire@@ walls bu@@ ck the protocol 88@@ 80 standards @-@ wise , there may be more luck with the Protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to send any &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously read@@ able pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try it yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check it out to check the CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folders for temporary files : if you tick this , you can / must specify the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
just type everything as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something must be fl@@ ashed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting compression ratio is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restri@@ cting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted on demand . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous WAV files simultaneously : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section it describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk runs . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was written in the previous section , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any reading &amp; CD ; repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD that is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the scre@@ en@@ shots look a little different from the data obtained for a &amp; CD ; with successfully obtained by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; instead of retri@@ eving it from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD will need to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , search in the FAQ section and find answers to the help section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the songs are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that matches your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database but retri@@ eve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the &apos; Current Title &apos; input field unless you have a set of different artists for each piece .
the comment field can be used for each comment line individual per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , it already contains the data as shown in the following scre@@ enshot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with upper@@ case letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desired comments .
note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this option is set up on the Settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags again .
Tags are not supported by all co@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the en@@ coder for more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the release CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD details anyway . for more information go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second one .
the CD Editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . please enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you would like .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the parts list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ eces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if you click on the button selection to read out the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track what is running .
click on the tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message will show you if you are trying to work with a co@@ dec you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully en@@ coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : assignment 4 is the coding of part 1 into the format MP3 . this is done by reading and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read out and en@@ code . with powerful machines the result is un@@ clear . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order in the queu@@ e of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; used today as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you know about CV@@ S , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de package . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many options for settings . it &apos;s best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows scre@@ en@@ shots of the various cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hello , still best to read ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this somehow blank screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start ) or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? those who read this probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual for &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; if you want to add or change something useful , let &apos;s do it . at least until after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing to this suggestion .
strange , if you &apos;ve managed to fetch the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player by &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time , lyrics also have some characteristics that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs on &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support too . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop to make you move in &amp; out ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( properties or text events ) . k@@ mid calcul@@ ates automatically the procedure used .
session support . when you stop &amp; che@@ de while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button shut@@ down in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played succ@@ essi@@ vely . )
once &amp; mid ; a piece plays , you can jump at any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo and change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play .
lyrics can be stored in two types in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use song ex@@ tran@@ ce and others both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which uses a song so that you don &apos;t have to manually set anything manually . so if you activate automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ a@@ oke lyrics will automatically be selected . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set up an event type , select the text properties and / or properties from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summar@@ ize . these are played down the series . in this section stands how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired collections in the collection manager .
the temporary collection brings all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when using the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button Add a song . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic Add to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu style sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to continue a song , select Next song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump conver@@ sely a song , select the button Previous piece , the entry Pre@@ cious piece from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving and mid .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers which are not General MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map converts general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all change patch to B@@ right Piano events into the change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ WE - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the necessary implement@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , this requires that each occurrence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END TIP key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map &quot; ... END TIP key@@ map &quot; A more key@@ map &quot; ... END TIP CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TIONS ... END
you can see that define is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email , so that I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be provided for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
in this section , it is indicated how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped onto your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM -@@ patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All @-@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all tones that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shot ) , it takes 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that with the term Drum @-@ Patch the patch is meant , in which each tone represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as , etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone is the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map notes to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply do it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name for this channel is needed . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , then always patch x is used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ B@@ ender events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch B@@ ender Event with the value n , this is converted using the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM insi@@ sts that a keyboard which will play a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are trying to play two sounds higher up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try playing around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under Settings , item MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to view the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Con@@ figuration menu View : settings
the tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc , so that same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ WE support compiled . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files one by one .
just open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable automatic add @-@ on to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop is a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my mi@@ di folders and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) . in this way , when the collection is finished or I want to play a file , only in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic add @-@ on to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you only want to play the first file . so set the automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly that one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue to program .

a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an A@@ WE card .
if you do not have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear any music .

after changing XML files , you have to select the play@@ list from the menu and choose either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same play@@ list .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ MP@@ layer / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be distur@@ bing in the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
&amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt
there is a tab for configur@@ ing MP@@ layer in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; here you can set the path from the MP@@ layer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ MP@@ layer . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this play@@ device in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML .
to allow the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; &apos; flash &apos; to play in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; module as service provider for the m@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash must be specified in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so that always a given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; K@@ MP@@ layer ; can play from TV cards , either using MP@@ layer or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) Settings in the K@@ MP@@ layer , the dialog appears in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the coding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
because the V@@ DR support from K@@ MP@@ layer can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presum@@ ably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video @-@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
the source of this documentation is dv@@ d@@ n@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , start playing the play@@ list .
is there any critics like I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as user root after t@@ ying the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile and compile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional scrip@@ ting application . Unix @-@ like systems probably rely on the package &amp; tex@@ til ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux ; -@@ Distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compilation and are included on the tile ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the k@@ ile ; website should be established .
if you have any questions or compile and compile it , or if you want to add extensions , please contact the k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; working area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Reference and the powerful project management .
in order to learn more about &amp; kate , and to know its options , the manual should be used for K@@ ate . users of &amp; c@@ ile ; can start working there directly with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . during the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
here only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master correctly , good books for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contained at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the \ \ begin { document } command and must be closed again using the \ \ end { document } command .
the Quick Start Ass@@ ist of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some options for creating the document .
docum@@ ent@@ ations : with this the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or custom defined .
code : her@@ eby the character en@@ coding is set . it should use the character en@@ coding of the system . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 en@@ coding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile ; a simple problem search is possible ( example ) : if you want to see more common areas of a green text on the screen , it is most likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it will save you time and anger through the emphasis of the output file .
with the automatic completion of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { var } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to read the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be checked in the menu settings ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub @-@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be viewed and viewed by a click of a mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful for backup . as soon as a DVI @-@ file &#91; inter @-@ dependent file &#93; was created , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ Viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the commercial output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using back layer search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked with the editor and once clicking on an element in the DVI ; file is the exact opposite of it . as soon as you cli@@ cked on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text is cli@@ cked , it will jump to the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer .
master @-@ Document : this feature is used when working with multiple files . with a master @-@ document , working with others is simplified .@@ tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master @-@ document can be set about project settings .
quick build : the lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is converted to a folder , the &apos; ¼ ber@@ wach@@ t@@ â ® , and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction .
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be show@@ c@@ ased . the selection fields were developed for fast entry of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick release of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection field Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting items such as Tags , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
description : this command creates a description for a section , image or other element .
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection field possible ) .
when using c@@ itation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files corresponding editors are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã © e is used for setting the font dimensions . it can be set up for the main text , the foot@@ notes , etc . the following text letters are available :
when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch with the hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class command contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; defines the written format . if the font dimensions are not set at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text .
once the source code above has been typ@@ ed , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s build or the Kn@@ op@@ fs quick construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; tile ; automatically def@@ aults to storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be sought in the logging of errors . when using fast @-@ build order &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font &apos; e 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the change of font dimensions within the environment .
changes are made only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and us@@ ability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat printing , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for cur@@ sive pressure and is long until it is closed with \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in one sentence may be ital@@ ici@@ zed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ sign language , a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile follows .
as soon as a bit of text was typ@@ ed in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments for the better legi@@ bility of the document should be executed . for this , a quot@@ ation , a few places in the fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl @-@ E can be returned to the editor ( for the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ gram ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are needed ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed ( in the viewer ) by file ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preliminary search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this only Modern is set to set up under Settings ... Tools Build should be selected .
to perform the preliminary search , the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked down on default search . the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI @-@ viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; k@@ ile ; opened and j@@ umped to the corresponding line .
if a bug is not open , a bug can be found . if there is an error , it will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file explains the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the buttons of the La@@ Te@@ X error and the Next La@@ Te@@ X error can be used for jumps between errors . in order to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and un@@ checked ; jumps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
when clicking on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can be either re@@ written from scratch , or the wiz@@ ard can be used for quick creation of a new document . for more information , see the section .
c@@ ages users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting a file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character en@@ coding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings need to be set .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex file . if a template is used to create a template , you should search for one in the Internet and see the steps described below .
&amp; tile ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
in order to learn more about &amp; kate , and to learn its options , the manual can be used for K@@ ate . users of &amp; M@@ ile ; can start working directly with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be called over the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with a pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that by clicking the \ \ par value \ \ \ big@@ ski@@ p you can only select \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with twi@@ sted Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; tile ; has the ability to search the most different types of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many wiz@@ ards can add additional jumping brands . this is a separate type of bookmark inside the text . the menu items Edit Spr@@ ung@@ brands or the corresponding keys enable jump to next or last jump brand . this also highlights this jump brand , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; tile ; although &amp; kate ; already offers excellent opportunities , have been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code added ; special commands for their selection .
a paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning makes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code .
this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a back coat ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; kate ; provides the key short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit , the following commands are used to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore &amp; k@@ ile ; for further commands under Edit environment for a more straightforward work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to read the surrounding area .
if the cur@@ sor is before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many ne@@ sted surrounding commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command complet@@ es the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not dist@@ orted .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the soft@@ ened closing bracket .
if the cur@@ sor appears before or behind the soft@@ ened clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups cl@@ amps , the overview can quickly be lost . this command is closing the recently opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple instructions are used as a reference mark . for us@@ ef@@ ul@@ ing implementation will be used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple instructions is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and provides two closing signs for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic add @-@ on of double quotes can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and out .
foreign specific settings ( e.g. german or french ) can also be used for German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. , enum@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; tile ; not only a new@@ line but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close the current line with \ \ \ \ with a complete line break .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be done under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables - and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; tile ; try to make this possible . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; k@@ ile ; after the closest tab@@ ulator in the above line . although this tab is not the corresponding tab , add &amp; tile ; add some space for the column &apos;s position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; kate ; already has a good source code completion , it has been added to &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are added . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings K@@ ile ... fully configur@@ able .
when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty row ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and possibly gra@@ b@@ bed the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are natural when selecting a command . alternatively , the spr@@ int marks can be frozen , so that a simply jump to these positions can be possible using the ski@@ p marks N@@ Ã ¤ k@@ ste and the desired parameters can then be frozen .
setting C@@ ile ; set up ... tile ; can make adjustments to these lists . various lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as utilities of general language use can be selected .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin typ@@ ed and the call to complete disable mode will have a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; tile ; a special mode for the execution of environments to perform .
when calling the re@@ plen@@ ishment mode via the menu item or key key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient execution can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input key .
once this has been completed , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; tile , recognize that it is a list environment , a first \ \ item command will be frozen .
under Settings icon ; set up ... tile ; can make adjustments to these lists . this mode uses the W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ liste of the re@@ plen@@ ishment mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; tile ; supports user @-@ defined lists of ab@@ brevi@@ ations that are immediately replaced with longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be set up . as an example of a delete list , the file is ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word re@@ plen@@ ishment mode introduced over the menu , or the key short@@ cut C@@ trl + Alt Emp@@ ty , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been found that many of the files in one document are written more than once .
this mode can be set up in the menu item K@@ ile ... tile completion will be dep@@ rec@@ ated . here , the threshold for displaying the completion can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Pers@@ onn@@ al Home folder . it stands for ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphics incorporate the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics on the graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to be able to understand the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all tree tools are group@@ ed in groups in Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating comp@@ iling , converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further transformation can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI @-@ file can be viewed in a file by Alt ; 3 , with Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command quick @-@ build , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , a new window will open each time .
a new project will be submitted to the Project New Project .... for this purpose the following information will be asked about the project :
when exec@@ uting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts aren &apos;t finished yet and can still change in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods has :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system where the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different support to support the users .

this is not only a description of all the programs ( but some important packages are described ) but is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands contained and is thus ideal for finding a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; / tex@@ live ; it is not always easy to find the right document . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the available documents and this for a graphic surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the added benefit is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are shown .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; nbsp ; . with the command @-@ line interface you generate random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is read from &amp; k@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails more varied and unique .
for day signatures the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig , read out . for each day , you use different signatures , as with random signatures , you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you a l@@ apped ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and insert your signature in the lower section . signature @-@ example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / save it with C@@ trl ; S File Save or click the disk icon Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .

output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already mentioned , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the recently opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book , you simply let the current job folder be selected . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to output on the screen , their file is er@@ ron@@ eous . please check the reported bugs and try again .

the plug@@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the wanted in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plug@@ in or a K@@ Part , we begin editing with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , this path is used to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on one project in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze &apos;s button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears in bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and attitudes of one &apos;s identity are important regarding messages and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of your team , there is a further advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leader when something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific occurs in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later on , how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that a file is added to the CV@@ S once it is added to the project , etc ;
on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ le@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such guides are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
inser@@ ting notes is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or typ@@ ed the @ ann@@ otation key@@ word in a comment section followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ otation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ otation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , is a role in the project : team leader Sub@@ project manager Fol@@ lowing the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the respective area or sub @-@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roll names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the ones : make the comment invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that support DT@@ D ag@@ nos@@ tic and support web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here are only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog covers a number of pages that are treated one after another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it . the entries are :
large / Small @-@ sp@@ elling of tags : big / L@@ ump@@ y of automatically inserted tags . normal Big / L@@ ump@@ y means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tags XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional Tags automatically close : if checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; added .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
automatically update starting and ending date : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic sub@@ stitution of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate coding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . using the Standard button , the default specifications can be restored .
standard character en@@ coding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than opening open files ( where the en@@ coding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies regularly so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a carton ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the standard back to the next start is useful when the user interface has been mess@@ ed up by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dependen@@ cy of views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by activ@@ ating non @-@ recur@@ ring warnings .
the place to change the behavior of V@@ PL ; to change it . it can set the display of symbols rather than scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree is to be opened automatically while editing and how deep a change in the structure tree should be opened . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , whereas empty groups are those where no element was found in the current document .
ab@@ brevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each one can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ab@@ brevi@@ ation ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third side , which can be re @-@ used from any part @-@ capable application , most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a default location such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plug@@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; Read Only mode &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in ref@@ uses to load . only @-@ read K@@ Parts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . select allows saving the entry even if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; starting from version 3.3 , troubles@@ hooting was developed completely new . support for the no longer required built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the D@@ BG Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a debu@@ gger plug@@ in concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently there is only one plug@@ in available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug@@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plug @-@ in drop @-@ in , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . normally appears in the lower dock .
a view showing the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger . normally appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the debu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a debu@@ gger , so that normally it does not need to be taken care of .
the counter@@ part to debu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
tells the debu@@ gger to start execution of the script and continually send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ ean starts , the script will start with the request .
tells the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution proceeds . if it happens before a Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ requirement has been given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the debu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the debu@@ gger will execute the next script in the script , where possible when possible in functions and include into error @-@ adjusted .
in@@ stru@@ cts the debu@@ gger to ski@@ p the statement and proceed to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain handy , symbolic strips of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions can be more quickly inserted into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see details for converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the shareholder dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day indicates . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool boxes allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only those descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type item .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a single element type element .
prints the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a section name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that groups the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a single element type item .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all tag XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ coding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be ti@@ dy and closed .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and review tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to select another dialog , its simple instructions will follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
below is an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 day XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; en@@ coding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , re@@ achable via DT@@ D Alter DT@@ D settings . this can be edited by di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = sti@@ lt 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Ni@@ ck@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User @-@ defined button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current key short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but on that it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EP .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us tries to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced by PID for the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us process . if from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the unique message is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the selection field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally useful only with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the default error output . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written to the standard output , by setting the value the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , there are not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the check@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings Settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use , enable &quot; Edit Day , &quot; when available , so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; nbsp ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this icon will include &amp; lt ; start@@ -- tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and press OK .
press the application button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar set up dialog via Settings tool bar . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to give you a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note , as the Tren@@ ner supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; knob is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
save in the correct folder . after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please fit their &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc so that their tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you have to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc / language . then you have to create the doc@@ x file . we will leave the first part to you , the second one we will handle here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these docum@@ ent@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the PHP ; documentation as something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level elements Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Intro@@ duction , ... Intro@@ duction = Ac@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but look out &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources are replaced .
for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function should be displayed . by marking the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context aid the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ x file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global usage . then create a folder ( as you specified them in your doc@@ x file ) and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ x files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners , or anyone else . at different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email sending , tool@@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . to make an end contribution we recommend signing the resources for which it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields need to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading tool bar tool@@ bars , and starting in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , expl@@ ores &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be ab@@ orted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format could be necessary . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can start from the DT@@ D File Up@@ load and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which is to be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Final line : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion to &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ rc ; -@@ editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand and full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit would bring .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . this allows the group of administrators to backup different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special promotions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which allows joint use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project .
Das &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the tree views , the boxes with information and the tool@@ bar . please check in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tab @-@ button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all map initi@@ ators , rel@@ o@@ ad , er@@ ase or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marking or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / past@@ ing / past@@ ing ) , editing the tags located under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , help to the word under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or opening the file , when the string is called a file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
at the top end of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and connected user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can enter the data for this straight @-@ ended tag . if you want to insert several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill different fields in a dialog .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with card holders are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retri@@ eve the information available to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , additional functions are available , such as starting , editing , or sending an email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element opens a list of commands concerning navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it it can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tab st@@ un@@ ners at the bottom end of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts executed are all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they are shown the corresponding command . the cho@@ col@@ ates page of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed table archive on &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to custom@@ ize the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it has auto@@ conf a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; html editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ! so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible all this , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase almost any task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the G@@ PL licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look into the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , special characters are converted to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Cl@@ othing , so that they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to paste &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
turn on or off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes straight to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .
pushing and switching the problem rep@@ orter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
shows the icon column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows for example , to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ projects you will find details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project Con@@ tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions need to be stored by setting actions ... to be saved . tool boxes will be saved by tool@@ bars to store tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it doesn &apos;t delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
enables loading of tool@@ bars on the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / re@@ fresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be refres@@ hed without rene@@ wing the W@@ hole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write per@@ missions in the global K@@ DE folders does not exist , the loading fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu Standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows you to access the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar is denied if this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above .
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available origin schem@@ ata depends on the kate ; -@@ version .
select the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ int@@ osh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes can take time or cause un@@ even graphics . recommended is the map sheet mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode corresponding to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
activ@@ ates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you will find details .
a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which can add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self explan@@ atory and should be filled most from the top to the bottom , since , for example , after filling out the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default she has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ org ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if this field is left empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in case of server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
make sure if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact choice according to good reviews .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project properties in the sub @-@ window profile or by short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 will be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) , which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supplementary option to the above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore will be excluded from the project .
the project view , loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
so the desired debu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set using the Options button .
in the Profile post window , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing a specific tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the event configuration , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , modified or deleted . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . you cannot currently influence this behavior .
to open another project , select project ... from the Project menu or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu call@@ able with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the upload files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button will be da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgot at programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server where the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply sliding the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened , opened or deleted in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar menu , accessible via Tools Tool@@ bar Project Tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are stack@@ ed best over the tool@@ bar menu . using and adding distinguish themselves . adding tool@@ bars will be treated at the bottom of the adding of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by means of context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a New Action , a New tool@@ bar can be created , there can be other actions like tool@@ bars remove , tool bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bars to be executed , which can be specified which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with settings ... and set settings actions ..
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ ps and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; uses templates as a matter of principle as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in some the limitations you are presenting for the file system .
some templates supplied with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each submission prior to use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information on the Tem@@ plate tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole Web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save as local template .
once this has been done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File &gt; save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with dra@@ gging and placing on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop , or insert the file tree from Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project files you can click on a folder on the right and create site template , enter and secure a name for the template . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can preview he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep in mind some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates stored files . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the Properties menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as the ter@@ restrial attributes have been sc@@ anned .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template . if a root folder would be set , it would basically disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or introduced text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and by copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation can already be equipped with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( click on it , press right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folder or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second one divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor at a document containing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is already active , the push button gives the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , with the position in the document retained .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source text editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta ... After selecting V@@ PL ; View can be adjusted between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation applies : a small chip for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow .
the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created . this is used for the reduction of the manual code . this can be used to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and key@@ word key word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file .
using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processor , moving with arrows . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and del@@ eting using back button or remo@@ del@@ ing .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the tables assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled . they will work later in the V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars have to be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be pursued .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path name . file names in the same folder as the up@@ loaded still style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a pre@@ age named QNA@@ P@@ cloud or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNA@@ P@@ template containing the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is expanded according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested reference point must be termin@@ ated for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

if a value is specified for the &quot; search@@ results sp@@ ath &quot; option , all output files are stored in this folder . otherwise , search@@ ts@@ .x@@ ml is processed by search@@ .x@@ s@@ l , search@@ ht@@ ml@@ .x@@ s@@ l is used with the &quot; pre@@ fre@@ html &quot; option .
if the search is run , a x@@ ml file named search@@ results .x@@ ml will be created . this file can then be edited with a custom style template to present the data in a different form , if the option &quot; prefer@@ html &quot; is not set , the search@@ .@@ txt file will be displayed .

if the conversion returns 20 times , if --@@ repeat is twice a value , the conversion will be 100 times
the input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for that has been activated in Lib@@ XML

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can sc@@ roll with the arrow keys on / off by the run @-@ up memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to commit compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name .
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the &quot; ~ &quot; pre@@ fix as a short form for the personal folder . on R@@ IS@@ C OS systems , additional environment variables are allowed .
path : a path to change the work@@ folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix is &quot; ~ &quot; replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; nbsp ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another progra@@ mmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; nbsp 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :

differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease typ@@ ing by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 folder 2 -@@ o target folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 3 -@@ o target folder
open dialog allows you to manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialog not@@ ices your selection and displays them again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
using the Fol@@ ders folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C however a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to set an output file instantly . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts then immediately . in open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the ab@@ ort button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d have to create two corresponding files , download them in &amp; out diff@@ 3 ; load and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can &apos;t remove &amp; remove anything ; only the drop @-@ down of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and placing of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . that is in the next section ( merge ) good to see .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + for example , white marks are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre @-@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line separ@@ ating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is enabled , the line will be scored points .
the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changed &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatic merge , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Skip to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative windows are used , each difference at the same time has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes by automatic merge or manual editing , no more line remains in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line in the queu@@ e ; indicated . this is just a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps again select another source . this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing numbers or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the sc@@ roll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the Insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying fails . be careful with this option , as you may acci@@ dentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ending of the source files , so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore it to the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in cur@@ ative script will be displayed . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator key . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will also be used for the next line .
when this option is enabled , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board , then copy the manual copy to the cli@@ p@@ board then .
you can choose which line @-@ end type you prefer for saving . the default value is the generally usual choice on the operating system used .
comparing files is trying &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return sign &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only a new@@ line character , but then files with different sizes may be displayed in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison though they are different . when this option is enabled , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
this option is de@@ activated by default . comments in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely looking for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also includes conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are handled in the chapter to scan folders and run a merge . see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further backup .
modify the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to stop and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following coding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the top setting will be used for all entries .
above the selection fields for coding appears a brief note , which is the local coding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
modify the file co@@ dings for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different en@@ coding can be compared and merged .
if you edited a file , you can specify which en@@ coding to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) This option allows you to specify the en@@ coding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn this off to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded index column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will appear next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just send the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . merge the current file in the merge menu even if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut distur@@ bing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at the end of the line . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient enough .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line lev@@ elling to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression of all characters in one line . the \ \ 1 in the en@@ coding string will refer to the found text in the first log pair . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . now , a pre @-@ processing command is needed for line calibration , which removes the automatically generated text : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ \ BAR _ \ \ BAR _ Date \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ Before the $ is necessary because $ a special character is and the end of the line would mean .
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you might like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line calibration . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 345@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hit is replaced by nothing , so it &apos;s deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / sub@@ stitution / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , some details are different with per@@ l . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre @-@ processor are retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . other operations change only the data that the line @-@ off al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ off pre @-@ processor will see the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally do not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders using &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes for each object a suggestion for mer@@ ging ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and display the simul@@ ated changes without really performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to run the mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
when you read the folder , you will inform a small message window about the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were then compared .
when scanning the folder is complete , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions All sub @-@ directories can fold and all sub @-@ directories can be opened up and / or fold .
when double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the name symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be chosen automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type again .
as can be seen in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then , folders have the same color . in folders , age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is first green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folders have been specified and when the option directories are synchron@@ ized active . then select &amp; use diff@@ 3 ; then select the necessary action , so that after both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then expl@@ ores &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the same date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as such errors are not eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folder cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , one file is processed after the other . you status column displays skill when mer@@ ging was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if the file compar@@ ative method is selected in the Alig@@ n@@ ment dialog box , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , sol@@ dered , white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged ) .
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the mer@@ ges actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not have a destination folder , C is used as a target in the three @-@ folder merge mode , B is chosen as the target and when syn@@ cing A and / or B is used as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the target folder should also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select directory merge / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to just merge the current element , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . they can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog box appears with the options of passing , simul@@ ating and ab@@ orting .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; nbsp 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select / continue directory merge again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it yet , a corresponding dialog appears .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , lets you choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proce@@ eding with the merge .
if some entries have been individually compiled , these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them again at the later merge of all entries . even if the merge was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged once again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files which fit on the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ orig ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous score is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the Element@@ tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not for potential recur@@ sions . a link to a folder which contains a link to itself would result in a final loop and &amp; nbsp ; cr@@ ashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
exec@@ utes a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , you may want to compare only the date of change and the file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change of the change date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this can be useful , for example , when the change date is lost when copying . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
enables the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that after both folders are identical . also the results from mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merge the later file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ original If an old backup file exists with the .@@ orig supplement already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging whole folder . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the folder merge view remains visible in the merge of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory &amp; text window between the two views .
you can also directly merge a file directly without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be placed on the server and the file will not be merged once you launch the folder merge .
this status , however , is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : list -@@ menu : new read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path may be relative and@@ . or .. This is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # contains the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder . then always a file is assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permission or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option trust in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as the differences observer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete data files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in the unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select the Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; nbsp ; as Part is executed , it supports only comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ are ) exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can run together like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using G@@ PL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have walked this path or get it this way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ rc ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as iden@@ tically ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this leg@@ is precau@@ tion but this is often the case .
this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort required was too great so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; nbsp 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !

this also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder when mer@@ ging . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after being merged . ( behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within one desktop as well as in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops and applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other desktop .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the blank background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager ... and Finish . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click also the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Be@@ yond .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the window manager ; it can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other desktop .
when this field is checked , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager tell ; the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . if it is inter@@ sec@@ ted together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st work surface .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the cache mode .
if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise , only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , like from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are shown in horizontal row and vertical right in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the Control Panel . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size , display and move windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently it is not possible to change the settings in the dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key win@@ dow@@ transpar@@ ent@@ Mode and assign value to this . possible values are :
since &amp; K@@ p@@ ager is part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages .

&amp; lt ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ mag to zoom a part of the screen as if you would like to read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users . this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; lt ; is a very powerful application that constantly extends to new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; this causes a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note , that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ Mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to later insert it into other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very Low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Sm@@ ack@@ ers &amp; etc ; .
also known as &amp; magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use and magni@@ fier ; to do this you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dic@@ apped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor per@@ si@@ sts for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( re@@ eti@@ tive @-@ imp@@ rec@@ ision @-@ syndrome ) and which each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cur@@ sor stays on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and to em@@ ulate pain with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can circum@@ vent the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move is activated , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , pause after pressing the mouse button . move now the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the to@@ es with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; click the mouse click .
when smart shifting is switched on , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse happens .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking with mouse button . if this feature is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back causes a double click , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back causes a double click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears delay , you can and k@@ de ; move to sh@@ orten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab . there &apos;s a slide @-@ down sound buffer , which you adjust to a lower value to sh@@ orten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , starts at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog . if you have already pressed the button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be switched off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later remove the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse . how that happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be quickly clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . you can easily scra@@ pe off the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started an im@@ position , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use with another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor there where you want to have it . but par@@ ken the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent slide but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can deal with it . it is very well possible to select text to copy and paste it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or perform any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably only once again cause problems . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . instead , select text as follows : hold a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while holding the mouse poin@@ ter at the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble click . as a result , each time you play k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the shift time starts when moving intelligent . however , you can also use the intelligent move without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension must be installed for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble click of the mouse is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor wa@@ its for a short time . this program was developed for people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling action starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computers speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; mouth , mu@@ te users can let the computer talk for itself . the user can choose from a list of conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the assistant ( left scre@@ enshot ) , enter the command that is later used for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text book . from the text passages you can choose often used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the vocabulary for words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally , you can reconc@@ ile the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to Wor@@ ds .
the main window of Pl@@ y@@ mouth is clear and basically contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a memory of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have just set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the flow memory . you can select from it sets which are to be spoken again .
with the menu item Settings Pl@@ y@@ mouth ; set up ... open the preferences dialog from &amp; mouth ; this dialog includes two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , site wor@@ dings as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , set the character en@@ coding to pass the text to the language generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the language generator as default input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection panel action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a passage in the Text passage book menu or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the flow memory . with the selection of in the input field , the chosen text passage is initially only entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box Cl@@ ose the edit window for text @-@ pass@@ book @-@ book , you can determine if the Text@@ pass@@ book is to be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
when you select text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the Text passage book will not be saved . select Before Save , will &amp; Ex@@ mouth ; ask if the Text@@ pass@@ book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ ger page contains a list of Wor@@ ds for Wor@@ ds . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can select the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can select the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you can create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically insert new words into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window for processing text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the bottom part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the passage or the corresponding key . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , tool@@ bar or a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sections of the run @-@ up memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sections of the default memory .
the currently active pro@@ position is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the flow memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is located above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow gro@@ in is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sli@@ dable bar for text box books is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar above the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output right or not completely . open settings to mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for the voice output on the map language output . ( see Settings dialog for speech synthes@@ izer for more details . )
the festival is a voice output system at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
for example , to display the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command to the speech output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ tet folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the lyrics in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows MB@@ RO@@ LA to use free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text to phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / ji@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last sign of the text so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / ji@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / DE@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . send the option data as default input must be turned on .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since setting the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; mouth ; set .
to adjust , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the preferences dialog at &amp; k@@ mouth ; it appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can print text by the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which the user can always re@@ vo@@ ke .
note that &amp; mouth ; no language synthes@@ izer . on the computer , a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found using help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows each application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to use their applications with T@@ TS skills .
read text ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; kate ; , even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
the speech output is used by the speech speech tool , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , etc .
allows you to generate voice messages on the command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in ZU@@ C@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services over &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a web browser and quer@@ or module ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; with which a text file can be read either completely or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ system@@ . the developers can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de ) .
before you can use it , you need to install and adjust the speech tool for speech applications .
for the first launch of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as there are no speakers installed , the map card is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the map display will be displayed .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . they should at least set up a speaker before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
when you click on the card tra@@ cker speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map card is displayed . it also appears automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all the speakers included appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for speech output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also defines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; Desktop .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
click Edit . if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the board map Spe@@ aker . to change the settings of this speaker click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the map charts and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use text card orders to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de . click on the map tab tools to open this map . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the T@@ TS System . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this launch succe@@ eds , the card card orders are displayed , and you can create text orders and read . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; t@@ ts ; further , if the field activ@@ ates speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the Control Panel &apos;s system section , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed .
with buttons in this series , you can start , pause , pause , and res@@ ume text orders .
with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de , cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all settings changed on all pages .
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the map tab in General and check out voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . check first if &amp; t@@ ts ; then select the text to be read , and select the text editor in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always sensible to select the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text to be read , and select the text editor in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; kate ; in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the mess@@ aging system of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fying you of events determined by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different kinds of messages ; for example , set up that you will be noti@@ fied when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name is present . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry notification in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the Tags br and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts , filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the speech speech tool . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace spoken words or ab@@ brevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain im@@ perfec@@ tions of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the &quot; speech &quot; speech &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the issue of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the edition of the screen reader is read , the retained earnings are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can be with &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you initiate from the card bill is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of Screen Re@@ aders outputs . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of these reads , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the issue of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify the parts to be replaced , either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined strings such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way possible .
&amp; XML ; -@@ re@@ formers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included &amp; Desktop ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with language selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the flash@@ card speaker , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ al@@ er@@ ts to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below . editing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of regular filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not checked and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the information below will be displayed below .
for setting string inser@@ ters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column consistency and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages entered here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the C@@ trl ; key at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs you get with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers need to be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copied .
the string release filter will only be applied to the text when all the conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the \ \ s word \ \ . the words must be limited by separ@@ ator characters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; print@@ outs have been installed , you can use it in the di@@ alogs or edit as help to assemble these terms .
XML ; translation &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is re@@ achable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
the filter selection filter allows you to send texts to a certain nar@@ r@@ ator set up on the card bill , or to a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; Desktop ; a text to the filter passes , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; dict@@ ates ; and the characteristics of the spokes@@ man set up on the map card . with the Spe@@ aker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help from entering .
to get faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text fulfil@@ ls the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speakers or delete all settings .
the filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programm@@ ers can add T@@ TS skills to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so &amp; OK ; this synthes@@ izer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; accessibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr on the other .
none of the above speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE does not work at all . you must then do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . furthermore , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found over the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only che@@ wing wel@@ sh is spent . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure that the character en@@ coding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be corrected by a string release filter .

the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the respective documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that own a license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package k@@ de@@ part@@ with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . download in the folder kt@@ ts@@ d . in addition , you can find the source code of k@@ de@@ mean@@ unter ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ age@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
KT@@ TS also works with any language synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the page of kt@@ ts ; , according to information that is not yet contained in this manual .
the speech &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses adap@@ tive module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend and extend for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the speech &quot; speech &quot; program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for c@@ abling or downloading the tar@@ ball currently created every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before you start typ@@ ing , check first if speech sound is working correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the speech speech tool . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g program is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sentences . the user can go back to set or paragraph mode , repeat the output or cancel .
if an application gives text to text , it can indicate the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have created a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen automatically . if you want to know more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker cho@@ oses , you will look into .
when you click on Add to Add Agent on the map card , and then insert a speaker in the list or click Edit , the map card box office is displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in PAT@@ H is included , you must enter the festival only .
select the character en@@ coding for text transferred to festival . in case of voices , the &amp; dict@@ ations , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you set the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and display this grey , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t leave these settings .
some votes such as multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be up@@ loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first movement will be synthes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply to Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the t@@ m@@ gr program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the t@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text .
here all orders in the queu@@ e are listed , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just edited pro@@ position . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card holder .
with the buttons in this series , you can proceed or return in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the map audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . for more information on the News Typ@@ es of &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ ml ; % about twice normal speaking speed . to allow these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; Desktop .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out what device works with you . in doubt , select the standard .
on this map card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language assignments :
the issue of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . once the screen reader has been read , the retained earnings are res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor will be too hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages are the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a web page , you can be with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . when both introduc@@ tory sounds and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map card are valid only for normal text assignments . for messages , warnings and screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; dict@@ fy ; to read the Noti@@ fy messages , start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the map notification appears .
check this check box to switch the read of &amp; k@@ de ; disable notification . if this setting is un@@ checked , the rest of the settings are gra@@ yed out and &amp; kt@@ ts ; don &apos;t read al@@ er@@ ts .
if this setting is selected , al@@ er@@ ts with which a sound is played are noti@@ fications of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; Desktop should do if an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the speaker you want . default select the speaker , which is shown as the top entry in the list on the map card speaker .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option , the action will be used which has been set under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All messages for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fications to be read as follows :
use the Save button to store settings for al@@ er@@ ts to a file . use the Up@@ load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Clear . all posts except all notification will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the standard voice used in the SS@@ ML output .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ 5.2 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits detection filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . this can start &amp; dict@@ ate text in single sentences . this allows you to start reading faster with the pre @-@ read , since only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , not the entire text order .
here you see the set limits detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further set limits detection filters , but beginners will get rid of it .
the easiest way to learn the selection of speakers is to try out . switch off the choice of speakers and select text to read . switch on the box card orders , which nar@@ r@@ ator &amp; kt@@ ts . switch off the speaker selection , change some properties and check how the speaker cho@@ oses . of course , you need to have more than one speaker installed , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; t@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can last very long ,
you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this feature .
for these reasons , the normal sentence detection filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default set del@@ im@@ itation filter re@@ tains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ news ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the issue of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal sentence detection filter from acci@@ dentally , you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the box card Spe@@ aker selection , you can over@@ ride the Spe@@ aker Settings for the application . the map card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker abilities are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; dict@@ ate ; select this speaker . otherwise , select the speaker , which is most likely to match the original character set .
select the method to enter the language properties you want by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , do not enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also place multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to delete all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default key@@ note speaker and then use the speaker that is most likely to match the following .
in this case there is 0 for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , enter 0 is required ) .

I loaded an extra voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ref / Vo@@ ices . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , send to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be so@@ x installed and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the map for speakers . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter to convert &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speaking speed .

at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER seems to not work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate string release filter and now I can go back or forth in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more substitute @-@ wise before or after . on the map tab orders are displayed , the job existed only from one sentence . what do I do wrong ?
you may not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , excl@@ am@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for set limit@@ er detection instead .

before you use , check first whether your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is dis@@ closed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voice , you need to enter MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) en@@ coding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the en@@ coding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the en@@ coding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic or KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . Das &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Program and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this slide . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed Di@@ ph@@ one@@ . t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German lyrics Di@@ phone .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Voice files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder festival / lib / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; needed is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival und &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the playing of the bug fixes is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

the command module allows you to use &amp; t@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a console , on the command line .
use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings over a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , like other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , creating a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be shown ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be fully installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , the device at all and enables the setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adap@@ ting following files , according to the kernel version :
the network configuration module is loaded when selecting the network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the choice of hands is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose from , which is best suited for distribution and rel@@ o@@ ading . by selecting non @-@ re @-@ queries the definition can be determined permanently . next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , change is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter system management mode at the bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces :
the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button on the button ... Set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
with the automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at each system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the manual selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . the net@@ mask must be specified in the input field network mask .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the app@@ liance list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the address you want is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching on an out@@ dated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as a standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if more than one network interface is present on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain specification by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ e@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the rider &apos;s name resolution enables easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . NS records can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry and listing or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons pointing or her@@ ding in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Servers dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted into the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit but@@ ton@@ . dialog is displayed .
the list of name @-@ known machines describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used with the boot , if no DNS servers are available .
usually the list contains some known hosts some entries , which &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add new alias will be displayed .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , de button Add several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a name known name from the list and select Edit . edit the Kno@@ wn Calcul@@ ator dialog .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediate in the system . to activate the changes must be set in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , when &amp; k@@ de , and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution can be used .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is not enough ; but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is only recommended to experienced users , but it is not difficult to compile and compile them . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second section all of them will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; variable configuration files .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found any major dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in other networks , on the eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point that uses a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a section reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 and 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynam@@ ically with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content found in the case of active DSL connections than specified there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is refer@@ enced by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . therefore , another stand can occur as expected .

it appears the standard k@@ de ; print dialog . if you select fold @-@ out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog .
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change user sched@@ ules .
a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup utility for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife put : how much longer does it take when you secure ?
before a band can be used it must be included in &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ verses the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detect &amp; k@@ dat ; do not recognise the pre @-@ tension on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ tension , searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the index is to be re@@ generated .
when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the band can now be searched by fli@@ pping the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ection of the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; quot ; Ron@@ ald Ray@@ gun &amp; quot ; wrote
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting of &amp; k@@ dat ; this process assumes that a tape must be format@@ ted prior to usage , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted by the tape of &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DAT drives do not .
after entering the tape and the capac@@ itance drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only save this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a hook . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Safe ...
once the backup is started , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once again and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Test ....
once the check@@ out has been started , the dialog box will appear for checking . in this dialog , you can re @-@ check your selection and change the work folder for the review .
if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears over@@ checking . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can start restor@@ ing , the files that are to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . it will only recover the selected file or sub @-@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rec@@ over in the menu ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog box will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can re @-@ check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current job folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected work folder .
for all the files listed under Backup Files , only the files in it are backed up , which are on the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are saved .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before exec@@ uting tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .

the settings can be set up via the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transmitted , and k@@ dat ; before the tape is incorporated , the command m@@ ts load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , trying &amp; k@@ dat ; locking the ej@@ ection to the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when resol@@ ving &amp; k@@ dat , the tape will be ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option in flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The tape @-@ ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar @-@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol @-@ files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup attempts to open k@@ system@@ log ; first , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not appear to you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not started with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually not found in the folder / var / log , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criteri@@ on or for entered strings . add a string to the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed , so that only log lines will be displayed . then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then compared only with entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . step lines of step errors are shown with a more prominent color as protocol lines of step note . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off a setup dialog .
if you want to display only a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identi@@ fier ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new upcoming protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might try to change a machine to system V in@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting .
the Sys@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub @-@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is named r@@ c.@@ d. d@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you run the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
you can also create r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . in the beginning area you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab manually and change the 3 . be very careful if you have changed something , then you can repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the proper scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no correct files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I might have a server run@@ level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; also , I could have a user running level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ dm ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply draw an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ s or change the position within one level by moving somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you drag them into a new range . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with Cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry , press the input key to change the properties dialog . use the tab button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by re @-@ typ@@ ing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc ) if it is available . otherwise , it will be recovered from / k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ rc .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine is constantly rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the lin@@ ux single on the LI@@ LO prompt and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplified the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this documentation is related to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save them . you can either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the File save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user and the user group list . to edit select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry .
some map cards are only shown when you have set up advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space constraints ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual adjustments . further map cards appear , if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card file password management appears , if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes installed .
this map only appears if for at least one embedded file system constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space constraints each data is in KB :
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system constra@@ int .
the Groups menu provides information about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Ad@@ ding from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate add button on the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group works analog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , add , remove the boot password , remove and change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more .
