<seg id="1">Translate the module web page in & konqueror; -menu under Extras website. select from the drop-down list to translate the initial and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the location of the entire URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made dependent on the translations without checking the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated into the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; this is easier to use.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the Handbook to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; load settings to set up extensions.... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the box kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror, before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click In & Conqueror; on Tools Cut. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module intake filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Resolver filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's up to date working directory on different types.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory at local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The specificity of & FSView; consists of portraying nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow representation of the size of objects in shifted structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">For & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can be easily identified when it is far down in the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & Unix command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treble representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either show depth for easy recognition of the depth of the nesting or the image of another file property, such as the name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the surface area is to be used by subordinate rectangles, and you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps's performance algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Trevisin & FSView; this goal is not always observed. frames are drawn to represent the interlacing of the entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As dividing the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is done, the implementation remains to be left to the implementation. in this case, it is possible to divide the areas so that rectangles are created, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum surface area for an entry on the menu item View Viewing at Surface. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the picture gallery module, a dialog opens, with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text box.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a revolving field to set the number of miniatures each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Specify the filename of the image with the check box filename to see if the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To display the file size of the image, specify if the file size is displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">Display the image size check box to see if the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog box, you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub-folders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save file in HTML-File, specify where the HTML page should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the interfolder box, you can set up with a slider or a turning panel, up to which level the sub-folders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">To copy the original images to the gallery, you will be able to copy whether the original pictures should be copied into the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment text box, you can specify a comment file for caption images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">Specify the color depth in the check box to set a different color depth for thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -settings provides you with easy access to the general & HTML; -settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -settings can be found in & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">You can find media playback for the navigation area in & konqueror; View menu under window navigation area or with shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror, with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you are browsing a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the label in MSIE for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry Entries... you can set the size of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digipack; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digipack; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digipack; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Plug-in Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digipack; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works fully in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG exports and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digipack; attempts to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu provides an entry to problems or desires. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error report system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipack; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digipack; learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digipack; participate, is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start digipack; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. just enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your machine. here is the data abnk stored. this path stays the same for all the image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digipack; will additionally use as an Albenlibrary. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, the pictures, as a base folder. & digipack; view each subfolder as an album. no image is changed thereby. while browsing the folder, you get a progress indicator as shown below:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durately searches the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders, unless it is in hidden file. this allows you to insert extra-half & digipack; do this by inserting a point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and taking this on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can also avoid using it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help raw camera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digipack; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, every medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digipack; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras record through the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digipack; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnail images may not be seen or the output could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things on & digipack; is how easy it can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digipack;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview to develop. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost every way as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it's much easier to add & digipack; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes came in & digipack itself.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode using F11 and Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping images works everywhere: you can lay a picture in another part of the Albenbaums, across the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the filename works only if this ind is displayed in the symbol view. what fields are displayed can you configure in the dialog of the Albian settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the AlbenTab or after the date the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Import images to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or postpone an album from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to collect information about this collection. to access the album features, right-click on the album and select the album features context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you is used to sort your photos when you select collection from the toolbar or select View albums. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums. sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons elder, average, nests: these put the date on one of the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. for this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first image in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As a album preview, select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections can't be recycled.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keyword for individual photos in the area My keyword list left down in the main window. album collections always have a different effect. the collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures in this album will be shown in the picture window. each photo will be shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album the first time, you have to wait briefly while thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using all preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the respective preview. what information this is, you can change settings digitized; set up the albums page and customize the preview images to your specifications.</seg>
<seg id="99">The preview images have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse cursor a moment over a picture, the help shows the most important features including all the key features of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that comes with & digipack; works. albums and Tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that fits you. image processing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo by using either F4 image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... select. in the Edit section, you'll find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. image Editing allows you to view and modify your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digipack; the functionality that you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. for this, and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata associated with the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. this will lose this information from EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digipack; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotate. in the submenu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digipack; delete it, it will be moved into the garbage bin of & kde; F8 image delete or delete if you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My data slipquot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digipack; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords in a logical way. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list. key, so that you can easily find the key words you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the key words in the loss of the database are re-imported as soon as & digipack; the images will be noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keyword by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; My keyword quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select New Keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this becomes the subtitle of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place it there. then a menu appears which gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking with the right mouse button and edit keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keyword quot;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and set it as a album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To use & digipack; s functionality with keywords to use, you first need to add your photos by keyword. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to tag along with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; you can also click on the preview of the images and assign keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can get a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, it will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword using the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the item menu Remove. the menu will show you only the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a timelessly adjustable histogram of the number of images per unit of time. a select frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, simply click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame that gives the time unit. this will show all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, dates and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">In the search box, a small lamp is the green when the search finds hits. if you click here the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this, you will get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filter what you entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are happy with your selection, press the head OK and the search is performed. the results are displayed in the view My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching again, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select search, the form to enter the search will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select as advanced search, the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select search in the context menu Search.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search creates an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database. all rules are displayed line-wise, separated by operators. one option can be added with others through the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond to each other. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar. if you move a picture from somewhere above the icon of the inaccurate search in the left side bar, it will open and you can drop it down there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digipack; finds the right images. also here, a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble fruit program. you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull up a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geocache.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the luminous table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminous table and its window opened. if you are back in & digikam; main window are, you can open the illuminated table with L extras illuminating table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane, you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right range of the window and place there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you want to synchronise preview from the toolbar and perform a Zoo or deportation operations on one of the pictures, then you can compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly sort out from a series of images. if you navigate from the toolbar, the two first images will automatically be loaded into the areas for comparisons. now, use the left mouse button at any thumbnail to see it in the left-hand side. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting desk like F4 file...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to connect visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section, you will find a built-in pivot function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to wave the visible area of the image, you must click on these and hold the & LMB; in the mode preview, then both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the Zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - apart from the modeword? digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the picture was taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage. each of the photographs capture, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a map and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and re-use pictures. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, evaluate, approve, archive, optimize, wait and export picture files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is stored according to your definition, providing information about or documenting other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you need to take a certain photo without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not use & digipack;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and in image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you care about anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files need to be organized somehow on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a dedicated drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location, unless you were in one year on the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; Export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, such as versioning photos, archiving, work processes, constant flow of images to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes stacking processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving the metadata option in & digipack's settings page. it ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the album.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change them? added & digipack; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course, these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should now assign keyword, captions and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at the next work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you often call in other programs, or Categories continue. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digipack; automatically build the tree for you or add the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keyword will be done by & digikam; updated while the subwoofers are tracked.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section covers captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anybody see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it more closely, you will be able to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I am telling you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beach quot; in the Normandy 60 years after the landing is. wow! you start to dream, to have associations, memories, the historical period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the labeling has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help him understand the motif that you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can store as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. KDE even provides you with a spell checker. if you export your images to web galleries, then these captions will be exported to your specifications in the caption and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are countless and will become even more profound in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually perform your travel through images with geographic information. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights, to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, i.e. also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the decor page of & digikam; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographer, for example to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may not be changed. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the working title of the photographer. examples of this may be the title as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider box to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to populate the author and copyright sections, even though they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can do this, in the picture embedded metadata, delete or change. for private individuals this is very important for most of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per picture. & digipack; in the near future it will provide such a module for stacking processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, plate loss, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, age of storage media, restoration, redundancy, asteroid prevention, life time, temperature, data size, multiplied superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, we are dealing with issues of the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled carefully and you can't trust them for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age due to chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a cheap program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray Disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-expropriated format. please read the media with a description, date & author and then store it in a clean, dark dry and protected place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers maintain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's preferences include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: disk failures</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discs hold the longest when they are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperature levels, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART may fail to determine the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete losses due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not matter much, it looks different for devices with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause distorted keyboards, complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed Motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip. however, remember that not every plug bar also contains a overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected by overvoltage. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors that also have a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it may therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection from overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system in order. if you buy an UPS then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the life time of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk exposure to your computer system and compare its security with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, compared to the hard drives at home, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are generalized to photos. your free memory is available to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures available in full resolution online. the professional version provides you with unlimited storage, which should only be verified in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol, and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed memory in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs secure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you open a photo one day. it's quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer way of data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within data streams. in normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started an own initiative with its btrfs file system. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in notebooks and 46% on workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not fully saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras include 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are moving towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather deteriorated. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk you get today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anyone else for data loss. so, make sure your data is affected by data loss every year. so backup your data frequently according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size changeover of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses every day on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will strike you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane dies: fire, water, electricity, children and steels are dangerous enough to your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Thus desaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups to the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a common reason for data loss despite backup is the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save it one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the one of the complete safeguards and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup was made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between files that have been really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach gives you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the workfiles. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC data stored in the image file, associated XMP files, original content, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to take care of everything that is said today with caution and re-evaluate it over time. unfortunately, there is no other way than to forge a certain vigilance. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been recognized by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdc [#] of = / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # modifies the size of a reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can be much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can use gamma- and chromaticity data for improved colour assignment on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open picture format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed due to the need to unify the camera formats. it is based on TIFF / EP format and obliges to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already makes DNG available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; proprietary metadata Platformosa;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of their recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits in as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, there can be problems when linking the metadata endatei and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format can grow. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide-ranging acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edit, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layer editing you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images back with & digimaster, then you should add the metadata again. these were cut off by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them to web galleries, encode in mpeg, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digipack; in the section Add a photo to an album, you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect these to the computer, turn the camera off to the display mode and turn it on. another description for this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished -indicator appears at the bottom end and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the application will be displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page strings properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab Metadata shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's notice, GPS, etc. of the picture. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking on the Download button and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures are securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the requested ones with the standard selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button to download and then download the selected.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not been downloaded from & digipack until now. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the All or Selected Unselect buttons, a dialog appears with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted. the list of existing albums will be shown in the section My Albums. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digipack; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete All button. if you only want to delete a few, you must select them first and then delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check if the photos have been downloaded successfully into a & digiplug; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do this via the camera file as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often don't use especially meaningful names as filenames. the filenames are usually re-used after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names, if you upload photos from different shooting galleries into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image was taken into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and file-based subdirectories. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options to be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in the standard car identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. turn on the option date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file names, you have the possibility to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading, or in uppercase if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digikam; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically once you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digipack; can use all the information about the camera's orientation at the time point of recording. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, you can use the image in its original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digipack; this is used to automatically download sub-albums in the target album while downloading. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page bar Meta data, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually disabled, and in this case it stores & digipack; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog box & kde; appears in which you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection has been completed, you wonder where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start loading. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and latitude and which can be indicated on a map. data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it is interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser with a click, which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to carry out the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, seat and card references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. there are at least three ways to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you need to save this data in gpx format since this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the Exit tool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals associated with maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation data for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digipack; try to give you so much control over its work processes as possible. to access these settings, you need to choose to set up the behavior of & digikam. to access these settings, you need to set up in eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on Embedded Preview or Edit image editing. you set the default behavior of & digipack; note if you click on an entry in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright-related data. this data is automatically written into the relevant IPTC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. even in case of database synchronization, these data are written into IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author: this field should include the professional name of the photographer. this can be expressions such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if this is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, then the group or agency that provides the image should be enumerated here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC rims. this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the data base of & digipack; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digipack; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image descriptions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the inscriptions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information appearing when the mouse cursor jumps over a file in the main window. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digipack; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digipack; to view, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the lamp by & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the luminous table these settings are turned on if possible. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size, you should only use on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better picture results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar when you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing this picture can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma subsampling means that images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting of PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF command option, you can compress the Deflate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it has no effect on picture quality since the Deflate algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the lossless JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not been supported yet, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & digipack; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. at present it evolves very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard acceptance is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixel on odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. this option distinguishes the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 mesh pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This option is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top positions in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed light, so the parts of your images that are burned into, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as a continuous white. the setting colors will generate some unusual results as they show the pointed lights in various rose tones. finally, you can try to rebuild some parts of the missing information from the shreakers.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not saturate as quickly as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you will get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1, but this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; -image processing. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data generated by the color-filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which is a matrix colored pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogeneity-Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the colour deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue corrections here. this is certainly the best method for color correction, since it is performed during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions how to be given back. there is also LCM and & digikam; information such as the colour information from one colour space in the other is translated to allow the colors to be as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image opens in image editing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder contain the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can store all your profiles. & digipack; then examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC Profiles You have the possibility here & quot; standard source; for your profiles to be stored. everything can be changed when the raw file is opened.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be compatible with the camera creator and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which do not contain any color-mapping or gammacorrection. currently, dcraw Gamma doesn't correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate how your image would be reproduced from one device. this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated. this could be correct, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's pretty obvious which color profile is provided for what it is intended for. unfortunately not with the models from Canon. hence, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profile Extension lets you recognize the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for Landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; picture viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digipack can support; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds is good. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right-hand side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image mode. currently, here are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have chosen a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera bar. you must specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / F3, where you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digipack; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window's menu. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures in the Mülleimer you can set the discussion of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you will find further details in the deletion of a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be used silently by & digikam; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without querying. otherwise, you need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the & digikam a welcome screen; to suppress when starting. this will possibly speed up the start process of & digipack;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Start Recording Start for new photos forces & digipack; search the base folder for new or deleted records / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digipack; if something was deleted from the base folder, you asked if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digipack; to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings Design. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digipack, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digipack; contains a quick image editing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry ad / editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image Editing contains a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digipack; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, displaying the file name, current file number, magnifying factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you cannot restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Restore or button UnRestore the image processing button to restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image processing action can be undone or reverted. the last action can undo you by editing, resetting, resetting, selecting Edit from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for undo and Ctrl; -Shift key to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you started the image editing, you can move between the photos on the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarge factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc button. if you do not want this, you can change this in the settings dialog from & digipack; you can view this from the & digipack; view the panel for setting the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File menu print and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print supervisor from the menu album Export. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a sidebar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear and disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can enter or insert captions with unlimited size. note the comment below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into EXIF- and IPTC- fields, so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are reshaped. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should note these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the button users or simply switch to the next image, the lettering will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and gradations. it can be applied either with a single mouseclick on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the encoding follows the schema in the table below:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword display shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box which previously used in this & digikam; session used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword. you can quickly limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when typing keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image are stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the whole selection.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword wordfilter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search views. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop key words. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view to provide you with keyword. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and place it on the selection. then, a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the example above, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is fixed to No Keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be or should be, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control section.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an advanced search through all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors from your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that are the colors that you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic comes to color management then everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at each point of the image processing workflows. the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and therefore need to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limits compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calliper my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour gamut or not, you have to calligraze your monitor, since sRGB makes the circle. when you work as in the sRGB color space, you either need to calligraze your monitor on the sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, compensate, Automatic shut and contrast expand from the menu Corrigate Automatic Correction are automatically trying to make the best out of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the fixture values over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot will be as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Levelling: this method adjusts the luminosity coefficient of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity can be as flat as possible. sometimes the same produces very good results when improving the contrast of a picture, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic levelling: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire history area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Broaden contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jib of all values in-between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited because there is a color space with 8-bit per colour. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright algorithms of Pawel T. Jochronym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original whitelab again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">This histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels can have very small luminance values. with a button, you can decide if one of the three colors or your total is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow alignment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play the stat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then click on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance that you have set you can save to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button restores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also give another photo as your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coding depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widespread JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as used for editing raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be performed by the subwindow for brightness. a detailed guide for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu under colors. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to store multiple color channels simultaneously. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool to gradation that you can find gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digipack; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the colored, darker areas sheltered the sensitive photo paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment eventually creates a negative image that so does not produce on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth picture structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminosity of the photos. you can click to preview the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce saturation rather than increase it. all changes you perform can be viewed in preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool can be used to improve the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, an active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into the picture and can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and watch out how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear representation is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively change the output values as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a faded picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons, the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded again later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overexposed indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it is not an effect to see the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifiziere channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel which is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most sensible. for pictures with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a broad beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve part to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marker is visible. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line appears on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposed indicators option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it is not an effect to see the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo corrected in the Luminance Canal. shadow and sun shades have been set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digikam channel mixer; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixers of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be seen for comparison with the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the respective color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are downright: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the image will retain the general brightness as well, as the channel Mixer is the tool for generating magnificent black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color becomes a visible sound that comes from colourless. farrowing consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you reduce the colour first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overexposed indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only shown in preview and it is not an effect to see the final outcome.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. preserving the luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the modified image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolling profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well into portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) Orangefilter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moon light scenes at day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepipe: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold to the shaded tones. this is very similar to the process of remaining a pressure and re-development in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiphilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digiplug; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarging points or how a mural on a wall. the menu entry Picture texture applying the image processing can be used for it.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone of this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; Add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for scattering eye. to add frame the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you enter the desired frame type for your picture. passing through the image with a colored line, Niepce circumferdes it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), it surrounds it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is from 1% to 50% limited.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any location. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. the bigger the picture, the bigger the character set must be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you selected for your text can be changed until you click the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Apply with the & digiplug; apply tool Template to put a stencil on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">Apply the Menu Picture Template in image processing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the & digiplug; please send an email to the & digikam; Mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you will need to set your stencil folder with the button root folder in dialog. select the folder in which you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">Once the root folder has been set for stencils, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template of templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinking: this button shrinks the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then automatically be adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digipack; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">It works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalization process needs to summarize colors with only minimal differences to a coloring point. this in turn causes sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images a camera is often applied to internal sharpness. images in the raw format on the other hand must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focus filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu item Corrigate Follow Focus.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should deal with this carefully, since the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image the tool refocus. under refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool for softening with the menu item Corrigate soft and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp maskieren is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount intensifies the effect. if you make the unsharpened mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will generate near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of a ridge. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should better sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the impregnated picture, which is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. by this you can define a minimum difference in order for a edge of the filter to be applied. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharpness and therefore beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the picture. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred masked. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which leads to this the mathematical result also from the source pixels, which are far from the original source pixel. the FIR Viennese inverse of the auss's folding is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels, causing unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should give 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your picture is blurred then should pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0, the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauss's edge. use this parameter if your sharpness is authentic. in most cases you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you chose large values for the circular sharpness or the gauss's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally Unsharp masking produces better outcomes than sharpness. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a bigger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">For the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image needs to be corrected. this picture has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Smoked knob sets the sharpness of the range of dimmed in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows an adjusted colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tabs smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. whereas larger values mainly flatten out homogeneous regions and leave details sharply. a value of 0.9 should maintain details in such a way that no sharpness should be subsequently subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions, while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granularity or CCD noise, a high value will generate wavelike patterns. JPEG artefacts will be removed best at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines relative smoothing. therefore set this value matching the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbular effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeats: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle of angle there [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. be aware that small angles create a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrale stride length [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear Interpolation: the higher quality you get by selecting this option is only small, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can hereby be stored in a text file and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="529">The module will be applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about digital cameras from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy sound that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow Details and the Advanced Settings dialog can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller flaws.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the sharpness. this value sets the pixel spacing from the filter towards the front to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication will occur again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend you either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gambit tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which are typically roughened more strongly. however, it also pollutes the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jittering. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store below and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool for softening with the menu entry Corrigate soft and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film production, scratches, compression artifacts and local faults that emerge in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frans and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm he produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are to be seen in the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can hereby be stored in a text file and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. it can still take a long time and a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beering.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction. the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera onto a Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film gradation on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected below (2) to see.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo which was read by a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photographic paper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixels allows to remove Hotpixels from photos with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppress for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Button Creator. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels using CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark picture to the picture to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the final dark image and will automatically recharge it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you correct the result within the image. preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are lifted in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the faulty pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line for a one-dimensional interpolation.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square interface (2-dim) or a group of quadratic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to compute a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic bends (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, a picture.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettiersquot; (shady) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has drawbacks. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may increase the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise unsharpening effects are created by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposing area of today's film and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a rough image that has been made without this filter. the tool vignetting correction uses the transformation with a Centerfilter to an image. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light absorption at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly of a luminous intensity of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing a picture with the vignetting correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, because you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine re-adjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation out of the color gradation; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a denial and contrast correction was also performed in the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but flattens the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, distortion-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion of the fourth degree. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and performs a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the correction of distortion. the values that you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tone or kissing-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. best, perform this correction first. if you want to cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to show the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the tone / kissing-shaped distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you rectify a kissing distortion, the resulting picture will have black edges. you can remove these with the trimming tool in the menu TransCut cropping from the image processing or via the zoom control of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, such as pictures from the front, frame and painting, is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera manually you will always have a slight distortion from the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infra-red film from GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left-hand side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for filming and film sensitivity (ISO). turn on the option Add film gradation when you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of filming and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in the conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos since the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura in the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter filming is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film gradation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film licensing phenomenon gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome pictures, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is set to ISO-2400 though often higher values are required. if you still need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the filming effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the film sensitivity used corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil paintings give your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, from the other side, the hingness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to sketch you.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; Filter engraver shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; Filter engraver is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing about the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to wave blocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">This filter group allows you to transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurred effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unity: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blur of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurring the image by turning the pixels at a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance unsharpening: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: photographing from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blur: blurring the image softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamor photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurring the image by random displacement of the pixels and simulates the unsharpness of an involuntary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Unity: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes this without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photograph into rectangular cells and then creates it, through the colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture. this gives it natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a proprietary algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows changing the size of drops. since the size of the image does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with the & digikam; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, i.e. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter regentropfen the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops of filters. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the machined image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can do it by mirroring or turning into the right direction. the tools for this can be found in the Transformieren Dreaming and Transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating a photo is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to draw the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm image inflating was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbular effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and load are used exactly for this purpose. each stallying for picture enlarges can be saved as a text file and then loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating a photo is very fast at what it does, but it can still take a long time and a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beyond.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently carried out operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and retracting the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with cutting, use the button The cutting knob of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Folding aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of height and width is always assigned to the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you're using centimeters, inches, or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can set the area to cut to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut picture and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The setup help settings let you fade in, so that you can put your pictures together better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-thirds rule, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle with similar harmonious triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that relies on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus mussel or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the Irrational number 1,618033988... and you were already used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden sharing in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 and etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos to your goal. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that the eye drops at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles are also derived from the gold spiral. their vertices are the central points of the pages of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonal on these lines can be placed a static object more dynamically.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and flip vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonious partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it happens easily that you don't hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is auto-cutting function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. please note the warning above.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your picture. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">At the left corner: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the right corner: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">At the left corner: indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">At the right corner: indicates the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little bit dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal bracing, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not rotation, the picture is distorted into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Switch your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the sling tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture is wiped out a bit. for a single shearing, this effect is usually negligible, but two shearings generate twice as much swiss and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing, the picture has unattractive triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transformer cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries, it is impossible to make a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digipack; displays only files in formats that you know. this is done with the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digipack; the file in image processing will change. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam. in the configuration section, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digipack; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression techniques on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to store the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save loss-free if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to know more about the raw image format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF using the body image converter from & digikam. in the configuration section, you will find further information on how to use modules with & digiplug;.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -Graphene. the graphic programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, in particular in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program, which & graphic; contains, are outdated according to the program author; - or & tcltk; -programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; -Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated and kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphic; -dot; -graphs. the & graphic; -programs are free layout programs. & kgraphiviewer; shows graph with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graphene in & kate; the graphene is newly calculated and in & kgraphiviewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphene in & kate; open or open the graphene in & kgraphiviewer; in one & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems of about 1000 knots and a hack to represent more than these knots)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraph viewer; is a & kde; program, which requires the & graphic; -tool & dot; for the representation of graphs presupposed. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphiviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screenshot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner if the diagram is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & alt key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file currently loaded in & kgraphiviewer; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; can also remember your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kgraphiviewer; to use it, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphite file outside a running & kgraphiviewer; instance open, eg; in the file browser or in the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance or want to show the graph to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the previous option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be split to multiple sites. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come to a page, should be adjusted to this page. if you retain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphs without headline and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Shop page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore changes) or the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphiviewer; specify when a graph is open outside a current session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graphs in a new window or in a sub-window of the current session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraphiviewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or determine at each start to be asked.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphic; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directional graphs. the algorithm gives the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges of edges as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">Der & neato; algorithm is the standard for ungerized graphs. it produces presentations in accordance with the bounce spring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates a spring- spring model for unerified graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold heuristic, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm directs the node circular to according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graphite file as parameter, and specify the calculated layout of the graphene after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graphene (directed or ungerified) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for ungerized graphs).</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the sane project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. choose the source of which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing ducrhe's default values to select your image accordingly. look at the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button scan. the estimated filesize will be displayed in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, otherwise some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the button scan, you must wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the image file appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screenshots can be created after you have selected the Edit &gt; Screen Saver menu. a window appears in which you can set up the various screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window beneath the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete work area, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other desktop, you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot is made, the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo gallery on the Internet. with Flickr, it is possible to show your photos to people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module exporting to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is practically your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send pictures to Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after clicking Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module expires to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that display the module. you will also need any other authorizations to upload. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as Tags during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Public, Friends and Famillies you can set the access permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the pictures. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI Module Gallery export has no documentation at this time. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows GPS coordinates to be added and edited in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and the location can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools to localize images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used here.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data, you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical location correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed using the coordinates in red. GPS trace data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera level must be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation setting indicates a higher deviation for the GPS time and camera level. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlations to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog box coordinates the coordinates from one call to the next, you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region and increase sie.Run this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery of HTML pages conform to 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is coded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albian preview and the text appearing in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be created in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Dexterity Show, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a sub-folder named KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you select the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnail image allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production. the web browser is automatically started to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI view viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and perform basic operations such as filming, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mausages. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After startup, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Loss free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual losses in quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases since there is no compression of the color information.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI Module Digital Camera Client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI-module metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list for the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the picture you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write into any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at Exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder Module is a tool to convert a series of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module, it is possible to create the DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD formats for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed in the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG slide show.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed in the image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates a very sudden, a high, however, very smooth picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it go black. you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as much as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the movie with the button code. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go to a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that codeners or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings on the right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo frames. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printout.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation of it is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software of your camera creator. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to convert and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button Preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later to use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before worsening the image quality. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a file format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion by executing button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use abort.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode when you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image that is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful in case they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image. for this purpose, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: non-proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the pictures you selected. you can add more pictures using a file selection dialog. a preview on the right-hand side will be displayed for the last selected image.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the list of images and place them in order to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button remove images, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures selected by you are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not take care to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Picture file format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted from lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original Exit data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages, on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will start automatically at the end. you can close this window with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to have your slide show appear. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL Output option in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option shows that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually terminate it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the individual pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, every transition between images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous one and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen, you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can go with & kphotoalbum; through these browsing, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, are now available in each group, so in people, places and in the group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you click on the mouse with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select to select another person only the pictures shown on which both people are to be seen. through this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your domain.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail image, which is of course also valid for locations, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the names, select the button on the right outside of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can choose which view you need to use for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you will need to specify which image to be displayed for each individual. to do this, you will need to open the image view window (described in more detail) and display the image editor in the context menu. here you can adjust the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you call the search in the main window, a dialog will show you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the lettering or description field, the descriptions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all the images according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here is shown by images, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but prefer to try the same features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog choose the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time start, or select the menu item kphotoalbum; -Demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try out the features of & kphotoalbum; try them.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this strip you can see here:. as the name says, this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours, and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database, showing the bar only 10 minutes sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline allows you to interactively use the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview screen) and the timeline will always display the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will view only images of this period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is included in & kphotoalbum; the one is included in & kphotoalbum (see). in the following part of the user manual, the included in & kphotoalbum; built-in version that you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and destination. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created, which is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last but not least, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed which is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, all images are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently, all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain ones.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can determine how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page, you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have set. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get a larger image, it switches to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a root folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can either select a folder or a KDE support protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, will be started. the URL you define here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them to that. so the import function, see, properly works you need to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs. in these settings, a subfolder is created, whose name can be set in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your pictures with them. however, if you have already spent a lot of time to record the image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc, you do not have to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if there is only one link to the file in the file. the advantage of all images to be stored in the file is that you can share all images and share this file so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either create a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have given when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for export images is described, which can be accessed from the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you wish to copy manually to the .kim file, you need to copy the pictures to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copied to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, since the .kim file would be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File File menu... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to import consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category persons of the file you imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named for your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked what categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting up the information about your images, through (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently this also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal Backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and will automatically reuse them for future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kPhotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">The menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... move to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user manual, the various settings will be explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can view settings for viewing and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available which allows you to access the F1 key and one click on the desired option for each setting.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each picture, for example persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, e.g. objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog Options, you can set up complete membership groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left window of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can call via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; only very little tested. that's why you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using this on your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications put their pictures in albums: here is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates the order for some modules to make use of the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, is all images showing you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album & kphotoalbum, we have to give the modules a list of albums. here & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums. so if you use the category persons for example, & kphotoalbum; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window that you can browse your image database. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the entry pictures showing you an overview with all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; this includes information about the people who are shown on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can either use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, shown on all pictures Jesper and all pictures are taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists using a text box by typing people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you can always use them again when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to move the pictures within the list: for example, if you have a family party and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by moving the names used up, find people quicker and assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add comments. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located under the thumbnail of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have added several images, e.g. with the same person, it may be more convenient to mark all of these pictures and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new or subcategory. in addition, you can also drag an entry into a category and place it there to make it an subcategory of this entry. note, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the strip, which form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button Options... which offers you, among other things, the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the button options... and hide / hide windows here. see the picture in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have not set any filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply clicking the mouse button with the middle mouse button. just try.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with an image viewer yet, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the removal button or select the Edit menu in the Edit menu. now you will see the window you can see in the image.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; you can also use pictures without saving you on the hard disk. of course you need to have the pictures stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, for pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back. if you want to avoid annoyance, such as the confusion of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Menu Picture, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little bit more privacy, filter the images so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible for others and click Current View lock in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can also view all the images that your little sister may see, and lock the menu item Anything out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have specified which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images shut, so that all images you have blocked are hidden. if you want to get the pictures shown again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered for unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other can access the password as unencrypted text, or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to retrieve the view on private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to describe all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he obviously shows the picture, but additional all information you have to enter via the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the info box on the top of the picture you want to see, you can drag it with the mouse and put somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is to be displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the then appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here, the browser will show you the right entries to this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the keys image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When several images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often a new image loads can be checked by pressing the Ctrl key and Plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; to be able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">If you are using the viewer, you can zoom in and zoom into the image. for zooming, you can simply pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom out again. the Plus-key zooms in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the outcome of the zooming.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the mouse button, zoom is set, so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out zooming with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work for videos. you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot have to put on the picture. at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you might prefer to select only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while watching them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letters. in the picture you can see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, they are available in your browser. so if you have any images that you edit, print or whatever is selected, simply mark them all at once with notes. this is described in. then you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you can display categories in the previous preview, then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature once the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you will allow you & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painting is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to disable the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select View on the image from the context menu. to end the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeling; you must not fully control the application of the program & Povray; but the documentation to & Povray; you should have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is shown yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the subproperty of an already selected object, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deletion either from the menu bar to edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input error and click Apply, or discard the changes with abort.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; enter user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a sub-order item. if you only want to render a part of the texture (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can rightclick these control points and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifting.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected, or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeling; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a present view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, pull the starter on the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing to the left in the hatch bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the tap bar. to prevent the closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view you can save with view window order... save. it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeling; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 up-to-date. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeling; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering Symbol Rendering The Symbol Rendering in the Toolbar or select the menu item View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode meets the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render Modi in the View menu... the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box under section and specify the image cut to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the Combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection illumination. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user's manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures look better with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the adjoining pixels with reference. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixel is separated again and again and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 will be charged extra points, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the defined threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued and tested for further subdivision. you can set the maximum depth of the recursion with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying & Povray; -Console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; import scene, select the menu item File Importing... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeling; not yet the complete command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeling; import, write this source text between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this adds the source text of the object to the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and pasting in & kpovmodeling; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeling; a scene renames. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">Click help in property view, open & kpovmodeling; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; search for external files (e.g. altimetry data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in camera view and in the window-type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object scope of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turning.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed items, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, e.g. the sphere, you can set the detail step separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail accuracy for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is shown in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you tick the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is shown in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the smoothing effect, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used to rendering scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. section window orders will explain how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination Panel Standard Window Order: displays all existing window orders. & kpovremover; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all the views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views with the button removal.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right-hand side of the existing window, with unts anchoring the window under the existing window, holding a map sheet view in common with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have straight & Povray; and & kpovmodeling; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the warnings that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeling; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeling; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wiremodel view shows how the camera looks at the entire scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation too & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points that you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the button Apply or press Enter, the wiremodel views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you might insert a header (insert the final body header) and set the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a complicated method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeling; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the button Apply or Enter. in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the level expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but in the moment you choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first subproperty. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, preview of the pigment shows only a matt black material, because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet. therefore, always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time by clicking on thumbnail. now, there are many possibilities again, but now take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and the ball in preview, click the Apply button and then call the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you are now rendering your picture with a click on the symbol, you should receive the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list, you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the object tree you have to enter the entry color list. then edit this entry twice (you can do this even more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to run this step simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeling; the ball can be as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the button or the button users), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise the ball would float above the ground, since you moved the bottom to a unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering is now a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already with the floor, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first subproperty and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on ball pigment, then choose one-colored and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply, or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeling it offers. hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer moves hypothetical beams from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the Render calculates how this beam will affect the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene that is supposed to be rendered is some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeling;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and memory space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reverted command. this menu entry can only be selected when you have used Edit reverse.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing layout.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeling; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change key shortcuts. you can use this option to set default short commands for & kpovmodeling; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. you can add and remove toolbars for & kpovmodeling with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to pre-apply rough surfaces without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a bump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base, by applying a picture file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & ball show; is very simple. the file browser lists any files that you can view by clicking the & LMBn, or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching filename has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Configuration - & Cooking Show; there are five map cards. in three of them, general and editing and slide show, you can set the working method of & kudexshow; in the two others, short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts can be set for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not big enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, load & watch show; already the next picture in the folder while you are still viewing the current image. this reduces the delay when you select the next image, and is especially suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Save the name of the recently opened folder with this option. at the next start, the game will open and watch the folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the coloured bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & watch show; set up so that only a few of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option, the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may possibly set up existing multimedia keys to function as a & Amarok; make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, most of which can be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde. additionally, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use this dialog, so the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue Loaderror error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow external programs and commands to run. to do this, the exec () function is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weists the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script itself has to take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, further information on the new piece (for example, the metadata or unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemix paths Contains the path to the selected playlist files when a user-defined menu entry can be clicked. to add an entry to the menu, use dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle) to remove the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user sends a script, sends & Amarok; the Signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, to do cleaning work. this includes, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archive (.bz2), which optionally can also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). so the user can clearly see the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaustion amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file's rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can load it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki template site of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>

<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. moreover, many different audio systems can be used so that THEY can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to relive your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Typically, you have to enter the following in the root folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Since & Amarok; Autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any trouble while compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options you can enable or disable at compile-time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>

<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date piece visible when changing the pieces means that the playlist window will roll up / down to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context browser, the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next item is being played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance Appearance, you can adjust the appearance of Amarok. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; you can use the otherwise gray colored section. you can choose fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. click Select... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1224">The on-screen display allows you to set up the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shade causes the text to be rendered in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if your own colors are not activated, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below, you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The option screen is intended for Xinerama users, so you can specify which screen of a multi-screen environment to appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The map audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection box. some drivers enable even more settings in this map.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, the & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also includes check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the selected and their sub-folders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor Changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folder (.pls and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the Combination Panel driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further configuration is needed in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql unit section is used to set up the database for & Amarok. among machines: will enter the host on which the MySql database is located. after that, a network port is typed under which the database is available. name: is the database name to which the connection is made.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the packet kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs it contains, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find, for example, modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedesktop.org, so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by using ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and re-create the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is due to the fact that Taglib is crashing when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this bug to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is slightly more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Ensure that all libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to plunge when editing the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate autom. turn off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarkapp: symbol lookup error: amarkapp: Undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixERK7QPixmap, then please check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd'which amarcoapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any colliding Qt or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most of the installation problems are resolved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also help other users or developers. use the forum and IRC below irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously pass audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of problems and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e. g. shock sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media need to be decoded first. you can't simply send a MP3 to ALSA, you'd only want to listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people when you're looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. in addition, some additional packages that make work with & Amarok are listed.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. rpm or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as every normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. in addition, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can collect and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter will explain how all the features of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or the current running stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired game time to the remaining playing time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch through the available analyzer by right-clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also located under the running text display. the PL button activates or disables the playlist window while the EQ is used for setting Equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the slider to set the play position or the volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous one.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the button EQ in the player window. once you mark the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that don't exist in any other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of features, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right-hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information about the current piece. its appearance can be adapted using context browser design. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three sub-windows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the subwindow starts off. the information shown there has now been distributed in other parts of & Amarok. additionally, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first part in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz symbol. click this icon to check the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Below the MusicBrainz symbol you will find further information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover pictures in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the suggested pieces are the favorites of this interpreter. this area displays the five highest scores of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last area, albums of the artist, lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button, and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow text the downloaded song text is displayed for the running piece. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using the help of self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok's collection database. no running text script is required for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The button Search opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - group only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to artist, and below is another split according to the respective album. if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Assorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown to an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically with each other. the interpreter will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, it might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly beneath the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. please refer to the playlist section in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box with which help you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time frames, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. you can also, of course, select your overall collection, whereby the filter is practically disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empty the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the current order in the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name to save the list.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Adds the pieces into the queue for transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter will burn / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(N) Move files in the bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Highlight the compilation marker - change the album marked as a compilation back to a normal album. afterwards, the album will no longer be displayed under various performers but under the corresponding artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser is easy to handle with many playlists. among other things, it also contains smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Add Intelligent Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow media player is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to use for example your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to artist sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you are done, click Apply. as a result, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, quit & Amarok; and loosen the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can pick music from a given URL. if you enter e.g. tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press Enter, you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be tricky by simply drop down. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces you want to play. you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired location and drop. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, search & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all the pieces containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then choose the search term with goose-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries, which Mike Oldfield contain, but not after entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: review: &gt; 50. this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is looking for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. for example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key, and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist's toolbar is at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some of the playlist functions. on the left, you will find the Add to Add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, enlarging analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar menu is menu. it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button. you can set up & Amarok's configuration via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example, play control and volume control. you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the most useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all the pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by clicking double in the corresponding display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the option status bar in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the window Visualization plug-ins. you can select the Visualization of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry hides a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover administration is a useful tool to manage your cover pictures. you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to display in the cover administration. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management gets your big entry in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function, you have even more control over the playlist. after you have set a piece into the queue, the playlist shows a number next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a slice to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already predefined (the details for setting up these are later followed).</seg>

<seg id="1413">Adds Pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (previously: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile to make this dynamic playlist work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag it to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select loading. that way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist, so you should save the old playlist!</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlists mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can add at least one piece from your collection. the suggested pieces will be added at least one piece from your collection, so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, enable the latest possible dynamic mode: setting Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as a starting point. using the same menu entry, the dynamic mode can be disabled again.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New button replenishes the current playlist and adds new pieces in accordance with the dynamic mode. edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings.</seg>

<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will continue to grow, the setting for upcoming tracks will be skipped and they will not double in this playlist. however, if the setting is active, the played tracks will be removed, taking heed to the settings being played.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist. this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece. if you set more than 1, the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The settings on the right-hand side have already been described in the previous section. on the left of the dialog, you can select from already existing playlists or smart playlists. if you tick more than one playlist, & Amarok will add random pieces from each of the playlists you have selected.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts make your own settings. you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Setting.</seg>

<seg id="1467">Open the CD copy dialog. this allows even without a project file to copy a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later. furthermore, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Open the DVD copy dialog. this allows even without a project file to copy a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also create only a copy of a DVD, which you can then burn later. furthermore, the conversion / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialogue is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to capture the entire (video) data of the source mediums in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Open the dialogue to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog, you can format a DVD ± R (W), so the content will be completely erased. & k3b; lets you choose between the write modes Overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog will ask you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be fired instantaneously by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog will ask you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be fired instantaneously by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the selected video, coding settings, and even ways to change the size and trim black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted media. this information is displayed in the content view and includes the properties of the medium, such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; when an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows to select and drag files to the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrower area, which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header does not have any real function, it looks only nicely and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the commands in the upper part, you can adjust the allocation of keys to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should function at first. this dialog is meant to personalize and fine-adjust the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script, for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functional scope, therefore your taste and type of your task is crucial to which the enclosed program will give you the default.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you are using the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions common to all & kde; -program common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatDVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void copateMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject. using this reference it is possible to modify the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString) void AdUrls (KURL url, QString) void removeItem (QString path, QString newname) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -select for & kde; with it can easily be audio CD; s read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; -Data in wav files on the hard disk) and by many coders that encode these WAV files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default. other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">Will be compressed in a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or even in other formats such as the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, the reading of the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other coders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile something themselves. however, only the coders need to be installed. if for example FLAC is not used, the installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the Chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction on encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoid protection, it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done (but the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily handling of reading a & CD; on the hard disk explains. this (hopefully) leads to an understanding of the lean approach of the user interface, which you often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; collect information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything manually captured.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. by step by step for example, you will find further information about how this program is used, and screen shots showing descriptions of the registers for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB asks the CD data according to the request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - when a encoder has been configured in the coding settings tab in the setup directory - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the standard. it must be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read-out file for coding is selected instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as logs, spades) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main initiation dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various map cards (such as encoder, for setting the encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among audio formats that lose information through data compression, depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. ogg may have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O 'not that' free, lame is supplied free of charge with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to ogg slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play instruments is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">H '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all songs of a title. good enough for music from young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without considering the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or retrieved by the software automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be passed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coders explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; Title to the keywords when MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button labeling in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information instead of entering it. it is to be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note the translation: with it the author is meant) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumble through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to specify a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb you can use another (fake) address used in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only be known by the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know more exactly, search the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading the audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the removed WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package needs to be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined encoders. more information about Kodierer is found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, further information can be obtained via its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and read rights on it and if both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; to read out. check the envelope of the & CD; this won't succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will launch the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, since it is considered not totally free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something inside).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for any reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, let's share the program with, the freedb to use the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them with any reading of a & CD; change when the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; -Data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive can be accessed, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map card General settings. there is not much to do here. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left as left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Please select only for incomplete information, so that you will be informed when data to create keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the freedb server while reading the & CD; it must be connected to the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down box is simpler, becomes a & CD; record found, starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Conqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, please keep in mind that if you want to enter all manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB servers: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way, the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, but because many firewalls buck the protocol 8880 standards-wise, there may be more luck with the Protocol 80, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send any & CD; data to the freedb server. disable the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously readable pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check it out to check the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folders for temporary files: if you tick this, you can / must specify the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just type everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances, something must be flashed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting compression ratio is 6.3 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted on demand. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files simultaneously: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine, you can try to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just have the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it describes how the process of reading the & CD; on the hard disk runs. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was written in the previous section, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any reading & CD; repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD that is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data obtained for a & CD; with successfully obtained by freedb. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; instead of retrieving it from the Internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, now the & CD will need to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, search in the FAQ section and find answers to the help section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the songs are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; gives, a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that matches your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the 'Current Title' input field unless you have a set of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field can be used for each comment line individual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with uppercase letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; this option is set up on the Settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags again.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coders or file formats. see the help of the encoder for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the release CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD details anyway. for more information go to the freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you return to the main window. simply click on the line with the second one.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD Editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. please enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you would like.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown on the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are selected. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece on or off. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the button selection to read out the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track what is running.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is currently read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: assignment 4 is the coding of part 1 into the format MP3. this is done by reading and coding parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read out and encode. with powerful machines the result is unclear. the used machine with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and coding (of however two different pieces).</seg>

<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many options for settings. it's best to read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the various cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player by & kde; besides others, with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time, lyrics also have some characteristics that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs on & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support too. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& mid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop to make you move in & out; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to mid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files (properties or text events). kmid calculates automatically the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you stop & chede while playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the Lup driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button shutdown in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & mid; a piece plays, you can jump at any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo and change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double-click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item, interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; the play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two types in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use song extrance and others both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which uses a song so that you don't have to manually set anything manually. so if you activate automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke lyrics will automatically be selected. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select the text properties and / or properties from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files, which you can summarize. these are played down the series. in this section stands how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired collections in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection brings all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When using the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button Add a song. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting Automatic Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu style sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue a song, select Next song, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump conversely a song, select the button Previous piece, the entry Precious piece from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving and mid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not General MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map converts general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all change patch to Bright Piano events into the change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM-compatible (incl. AWE - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file that stores all the necessary implementations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, this requires that each occurrence has a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END TIP keymap "Name of keymap"... END TIP keymap "A more keymap"... END TIP CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You can see that define is used to indicate that a section begins (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email, so that I can provide support in future versions of & kmid; support can be provided for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, it is indicated how the patches of General MIDI are mapped onto your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM -patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional All-KeysTo M is used to put all tones that this instrument needs to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60) which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (rifle shot), it takes 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term Drum-Patch the patch is meant, in which each tone represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas, etc;) and not the one in which the tone is the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are shown on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map notes to the percussions channel. take a look at the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">If you use the keymap option, the keymap with the name name for this channel is needed. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, then always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio is, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender Event with the value n, this is converted using the n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM insists that a keyboard which will play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to play two sounds higher up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try playing around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog. you can find this in the menu under Settings, item MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to view the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Configuration menu View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc, so that same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Just open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag it to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic add-on to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; Desktop is a & konqueror; -window with my midi folders and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a karaoke file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file). in this way, when the collection is finished or I want to play a file, only in the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic add-on to the collection, and the new one; file is added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you only want to play the first file. so set the automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly that one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; I'm trying to take a bit of time for my hobbies.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a MIDI / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact with friends of & kmid (if you want it). before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & mid; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money for it. I want to emphasize that I can only reprogrammer because / if I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pfeffer, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and everyone who sent me a patch, an error message or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also apply to all these outstanding musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke-files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid; can also be found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, look for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your soundcard. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear any music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as for playback of DVD, VCD, or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. there is always the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only appear when information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category of Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the play starts with the clicked item.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / directory can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, select from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the playlist from the menu and choose either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable another animation. & KMPlayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be disturbing in the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">& lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playdevice in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything needs to be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To allow the & KMPlayer; 'flash' to play in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash must be specified in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a given backend for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) Settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog appears in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the coding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Because the VDR support from KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (presumably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video-forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">The source of this documentation is dvdnsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. when enabled, start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any critics like I can quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command can be run as user root after tying the device. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom can be found on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1741">QT;: & Qt; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile and compile.</seg>
<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional scripting application. Unix-like systems probably rely on the package & textil; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components may be included in the used & Linux; -Distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & kile; -Project contains some already compiled packages from & kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compilation and are included on the tile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with & latex;, & kde;, & kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users do not have to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact via the kile; website should be established.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have any questions or compile and compile it, or if you want to add extensions, please contact the kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; working area. & kile; offers the ability to use all & latex; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple, direct and customized access to all & latex; -programs. furthermore, the easy-to-use wizard, the & latex; -Reference and the powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">In order to learn more about & kate, and to know its options, the manual should be used for Kate. users of & cile; can start working there directly with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the right language: Lay-TECH. during the original & tex; difficult to use, a Laie (English lay) & latex; -macros can also be used. a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it descends from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Here only a good overview to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book. to be able to master correctly, good books for example H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contained at least the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the\\ begin {document} command and must be closed again using the\\ end {document} command.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Assist of & kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & kile; the selection of the wizard (MenÃ ¼) provides some options for creating the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Documentations: with this the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [report], report [report], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], foils [prosper] or custom defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Code: hereby the character encoding is set. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add packages for & latex; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the documentation classes of KOMA-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is just a brief description of the functions and further information on this are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & kile; a simple problem search is possible (example): if you want to see more common areas of a green text on the screen, it is most likely that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, it will save you time and anger through the emphasis of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environment, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {var}) of & kile; automatically creates an empty line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to read the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be checked in the menu settings... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and sub-paragraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be viewed and viewed by a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful for backup. as soon as a DVI-file [inter-dependent file] was created, jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -Viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; -Source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the commercial output of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using back layer search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked with the editor and once clicking on an element in the DVI; file is the exact opposite of it. as soon as you clicked on a section in the & latex; source text is clicked, it will jump to the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this feature is used when working with multiple files. with a master-document, working with others is simplified .tex files are simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master-document can be set about project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick build: the latex; -source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is converted to a folder, the '¼ berwachtâ ®, and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large selection fields should be showcased. the selection fields were developed for fast entry of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the quick release of the document into parts, chapters, sections... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Further is for inserting items such as Tags, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Description: this command creates a description for a section, image or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a specified term (select a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using citation, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files corresponding editors are necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã © e is used for setting the font dimensions. it can be set up for the main text, the footnotes, etc. the following text letters are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch with the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the\\ 'documentclass command contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] defines the written format. if the font dimensions are not set at the beginning, this can also happen later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been typed, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s build or the Knopfs quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & tile; automatically defaults to storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be sought in the logging of errors. when using fast-build order & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font 'e 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow the change of font dimensions within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are made only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat printing, cursive pressure, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for cursive pressure and is long until it is closed with\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in one sentence may be italicized with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; -sign language, a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was typed in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better legibility of the document should be executed. for this, a quotation, a few places in the fat and cursive pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl-E can be returned to the editor (for the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I ngram). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are needed (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed (in the viewer) by file (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI file is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preliminary search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides an appropriate setting for all & latex; -binaries. to do this only Modern is set to set up under Settings... Tools Build should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To perform the preliminary search, the mouse-cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked down on default search. the jump to the corresponding point in the DVI-viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & kile; opened and jumped to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If a bug is not open, a bug can be found. if there is an error, it will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file explains the source of error in the source code. in the editor, the buttons of the LaTeX error and the Next LaTeX error can be used for jumps between errors. in order to view the erroneous line, the error must be clicked in the logging and unchecked; jumps to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicking on the button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can be either rewritten from scratch, or the wizard can be used for quick creation of a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Cages users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting a file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings need to be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can select your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex file. if a template is used to create a template, you should search for one in the Internet and see the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& tile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">In order to learn more about & kate, and to learn its options, the manual can be used for Kate. users of & Mile; can start working directly with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex command reference, which can be called over the menu LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be used in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with a pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. this means that by clicking the\\ par value\\\ bigskip you can only select\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with twisted Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& tile; has the ability to search the most different types of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizards can add additional jumping brands. this is a separate type of bookmark inside the text. the menu items Edit Sprungbrands or the corresponding keys enable jump to next or last jump brand. this also highlights this jump brand, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & tile; although & kate; already offers excellent opportunities, have been added to & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code added; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">A paragraph includes a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with perpendicular lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning makes tables, & latex; -commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also includes & latex; commands with a back coat (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & kate; provides the key shortcut Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers with its own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit, the following commands are used to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore & kile; for further commands under Edit environment for a more straightforward work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to read the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">With the input of many nested surrounding commands, the overview can quickly be lost. this command completes the recently opened environment, so that the nested surrounding structure is not distorted.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups which are determined by parentheses {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the softened closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor appears before or behind the softened clamp of a & tex; group #, jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups clamps, the overview can quickly be lost. this command is closing the recently opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a reference mark. for usefuling implementation will be used in & kile; the sign "for two simple instructions is used. & kile; knows this case and provides two closing signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic add-on of double quotes can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX will be switched on and out.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Foreign specific settings (e.g. german or french) can also be used for German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">If the current position is within a list environment (e.g., enumerate or itemize), & tile; not only a newline but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close the current line with\\\\ with a complete line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be done under Settings... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables - and all Et characters (amp;) among themselves. & tile; try to make this possible. by pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & kile; after the closest tabulator in the above line. although this tab is not the corresponding tab, add & tile; add some space for the column's position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already has a good source code completion, it has been added to & kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;) are added. three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings Kile... fully configurable.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty row (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and possibly grabbed the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be smaller by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are natural when selecting a command. alternatively, the sprint marks can be frozen, so that a simply jump to these positions can be possible using the skip marks NÃ ¤kste and the desired parameters can then be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Setting Cile; set up... tile; can make adjustments to these lists. various lists for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as utilities of general language use can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin typed and the call to complete disable mode will have a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & tile; a special mode for the execution of environments to perform.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the replenishment mode via the menu item or key key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient execution can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been completed, the environment will be automatically closed again. once & tile, recognize that it is a list environment, a first\\ item command will be frozen.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings icon; set up... tile; can make adjustments to these lists. this mode uses the WÃ ¶ rterliste of the replenishment mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& tile; supports user-defined lists of abbreviations that are immediately replaced with longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile can be set up. as an example of a delete list, the file is example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is typed and the word replenishment mode introduced over the menu, or the key shortcut Ctrl + Alt Empty, the letter L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large WÃ ¶ rters are not helpful for automatic execution. however, it has been found that many of the files in one document are written more than once.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu item Kile... tile completion will be deprecated. here, the threshold for displaying the completion can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / of the Personnal Home folder. it stands for abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphics incorporate the insertion of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics on the graphics formats, the sections should be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as popular as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To be able to understand the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all tree tools are grouped in groups in MenÃ ¼ s Creating compiling, converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further transformation can be used by pressing Alt; 2. after that, the DVI-file can be viewed in a file by Alt; 3, with Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command quick-build, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer should be used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be submitted to the Project New Project.... for this purpose the following information will be asked about the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When executing the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows the execution of ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed via scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts aren't finished yet and can still change in other versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First, it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods has:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system where the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages. & kile; offers a lot of different support to support the users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not only a description of all the programs (but some important packages are described) but is a complete instruction manual for the & latex; commands contained and is thus ideal for finding a particular formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Because of the amount of documents with which & tetex; / textil; / texlive; it is not always easy to find the right document. as possible help & tetex; / textil; the small application texdoctk, which contains a database with all the available documents and this for a graphic surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the added benefit is the search for package names or keywords. from & kile; then only the results are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; -Source text editor which can be executed on all systems with installed & kde; - and Unix-like systems. & kile; is also a part of the Fink project, allowing & kile; also on & Mac; with installed OS-X can be executed.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. Nickname is the nickname of the user and serves for unambiguous identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze's button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears in bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and attitudes of one's identity are important regarding messages and notes. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of your team, there is a further advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leader when something is happening. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific occurs in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later on, how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that a file is added to the CVS once it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the site event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>

<seg id="1943">Inserting notes is simple. it can either be selected from the editor context menu or typed the @ annotation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, is a role in the project: team leader Subproject manager Following the area and sub-project leaders, the respective area or sub-project names should be given, as in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / Small-spelling of tags: big / Lumpy of automatically inserted tags. normal Big / Lumpy means the tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tags XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal big / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional Tags automatically close: if checked, for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this is immediately after the & gt; added.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update starting and ending date: when switched on, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic substitution of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. using the Standard button, the default specifications can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or in other ways than opening open files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in a separate view (or the documentation in a carton), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of VPL; to change it. it can set the display of symbols rather than scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source code view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the figure of the parser node in the document, can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree is to be opened automatically while editing and how deep a change in the structure tree should be opened. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, whereas empty groups are those where no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each one can be valid for several & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the abbreviation abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart-applications from the third side, which can be re-used from any part-capable application, most well-known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located at a default location such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Read Only mode" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-read KParts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; starting from version 3.3, troubleshooting was developed completely new. support for the no longer required built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently there is only one plugin available, support for use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the button options next to the Debugger Plug-in drop-in, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed, with line numbers and conditions. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view showing the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. normally appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger if necessary, or it tells the plug-in to listen to Debugger requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally it does not need to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the noise according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server for a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Tells the debugger to start execution of the script and continually send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a Debuganean starts, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Tells the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution proceeds. if it happens before a Debuganrequirement has been given, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next script in the script, where possible when possible in functions and include into error-adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and proceed to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag folders contain handy, symbolic strips of image buttons (above the editing window), the text and instructions can be more quickly inserted into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see details for converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the shareholder dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day indicates. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool boxes allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only those descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2018">Spaces don't affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; character. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and review tagXML. to select another dialog, its simple instructions will follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check only takes place when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Below is an example for a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 day XML file. in this file, a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User-defined button, a key shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current key shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but on that it is not limited) that change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line like sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way, & quantaplus tries to find the script at the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced by PID for the current & quantaplus process. if from & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the unique message is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used for controlling & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the selection field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally useful only with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the default error output. it can be specified, which is to be done with the text written to the standard output, by setting the value the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the checkup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use, enable "Edit Day," when available, so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & nbsp;, Graphics more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this icon will include & lt; start-- tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it has to be connected with the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the application button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar set up dialog via Settings tool bar. make sure the toolbar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to give you a quick way to access the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note, as the Trenner supports the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; knob is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save in the correct folder. after NeweXML does not exist, it will be created in root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please fit their & descriptionrc so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most noteworthy extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you have to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc / language. then you have to create the docx file. we will leave the first part to you, the second one we will handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation section 1 = Section1.html section 2 = func2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the PHP; documentation as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Introduction,... Introduction = Action.html... Language Reference = basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces don't affect anything, but look out & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">For example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context aid the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docx file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global usage. then create a folder (as you specified them in your docx file) and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docx files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners, or anyone else. at different places there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email sending, toolbar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. to make an end contribution we recommend signing the resources for which it requires a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New resource, the input fields need to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), uploading tool bar toolbars, and starting in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, explores & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in day XML format could be necessary. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can start from the DTD File Upload and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which is to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Final line: the string that appears in the! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion to & descriptionrc; -editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand and full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarise themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit would bring.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to backup different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special promotions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which allows joint use of special tools and samples from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">Das & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing window, the tree views, the boxes with information and the toolbar. please check in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab-button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as closing the current, other or all map initiators, reload, erase or upload the document, jump to a bookmarking or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (cutting / pasting / pasting), editing the tags located under the mouse-cursor, help to the word under the mouse-cursor or opening the file, when the string is called a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window, the toolbars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and connected user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; pgt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can enter the data for this straight-ended tag. if you want to insert several attributes (such as anchors), you can fill different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) enable to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and roam. in the presentation with card holders are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage files in the project by right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading, or deleting files from the storage medium can be done with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website, etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the information available to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, additional functions are available, such as starting, editing, or sending an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking of an element opens a list of commands concerning navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it it can change attributes and namespaces. the entry system aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tab stunners at the bottom end of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts executed are all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they are shown the corresponding command. the chocolates page of the toolbars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed table archive on & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure it in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of & quantaplus; it has autoconf a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of her bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & html editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde! so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be noted that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffolding is not only possible all this, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can increase almost any task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More details in the help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or helpcenter help: / Quanta execute).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list is changed every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look into the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard, special characters are converted to & HTML; -Clothing, so that they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; -write which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to paste & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Turn on or off the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes straight to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Pushing and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Shows the icon column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows for example, to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, like & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; -projects you will find details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in Project Contoolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be stored by setting actions... to be saved. tool boxes will be saved by toolbars to store toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. it doesn't delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps the & quantaplus; -Team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables loading of toolbars on the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD; you or someone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP should be refreshed without renewing the Whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permissions in the global KDE folders does not exist, the loading fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu Standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows you to access the current tag creation dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">This only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by toolbar is denied if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available origin schemata depends on the kate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-end identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, changeover sometimes can take time or cause uneven graphics. recommended is the map sheet mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode corresponding to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Activates the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influence any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you delete entries from the toolbars, or which can add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self explanatory and should be filled most from the top to the bottom, since, for example, after filling out the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the Quantaplus; project file. by default she has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.org) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If this field is left empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in case of server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Make sure if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can select an exact choice according to good reviews.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the sub-window profile or by shortcut Shift; F7 will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcard possible), which will be ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to the above, also files listed in .cvsignore will be excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">So the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile post window, high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing a specific tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration, event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added, modified or deleted. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. you cannot currently influence this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the Project menu or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the context menu callable with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the upload files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button will be dazzled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgot at programming. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server where the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in one project, i.e. by simply sliding the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened, opened or deleted in the Project or Project Toolbar menu, accessible via Tools Toolbar Project Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are stacked best over the toolbar menu. using and adding distinguish themselves. adding toolbars will be treated at the bottom of the adding of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by means of context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a New Action, a New toolbar can be created, there can be other actions like toolbars remove, tool bar renaming or toolbars to be executed, which can be specified which actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>

<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snips and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates as a matter of principle as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in some the limitations you are presenting for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some templates supplied with & quantaplus have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each submission prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specialized documents are created in appropriate subfolders. you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. see for more information on the Template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole Web sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As template save as local template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File &gt; save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with dragging and placing on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as drag and drop, or insert the file tree from Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project files you can click on a folder on the right and create site template, enter and secure a name for the template. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very goal-oriented approach. you can preview headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep in mind some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates stored files. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the Properties menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as the terrestrial attributes have been scanned.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template. if a root folder would be set, it would basically disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you'll probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or introduced text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and by copying contents templates to a folder with special headers / footers a whole presentation can already be equipped with the appropriate headlines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (click on it, press right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folder or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & Source text editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second one divides the editor window into two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; -Editor at a document containing & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that at the same time the changes in the source text editor and the VPL; editor are visible and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is active, this mode is already active, the push button gives the active cursor from one window to another, with the position in the document retained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and source text editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta... After selecting VPL; View can be adjusted between synchronization by one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation applies: a small chip for fast calculators and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created. this is used for the reduction of the manual code. this can be used to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta-elements. the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible as in a word processor, moving with arrows. in rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting using back button or remodeling.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbars, as in the source code editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags previously existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. if an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled. they will work later in the VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars have to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style sheet can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2272">The input documents are treated as HTML files if the support for that has been activated in LibXML</seg>
<seg id="2273">Activates the XInclude processing of the input document when the support for it has been activated in LibXML. this is enabled as default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2274">On systems with installed Readline library, you can scroll with the arrow keys on / off by the run-up memory of the previously executed commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Multiple commands require more than one argument. quotes can be used to commit compound expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as an argument, a holding point is set in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & nbsp;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& nbsp 3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& nbsp; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & quot; Ronald Raygun & quot; wrote</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease typing by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner2 folder 2 kdiff3 Ordner2 folder 2 -o target folder kdiff3 folder 1 Ordner2 Ordner3 kdiff3 folder 1 Ordner2 Ordner3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows you to manually typing filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. open dialog notices your selection and displays them again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the Folders folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C however a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to set an output file instantly. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts then immediately. in open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the abort button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you'd have to create two corresponding files, download them in & out diff3; load and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove & remove anything; only the drop-down of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and placing of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. that is in the next section (merge) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + for example, white marks are only relevant in strings and comments, for the pre-processor and in a few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is enabled, the line will be scored points.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changed] if you edited the result. usually, it contains already text by automatic merge, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Skip to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference at the same time has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also highlight a jump of position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merge or manual editing, no more line remains in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no line in the queue; indicated. this is just a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps again select another source. this text will not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignoring numbers or Ignoriere C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-Up) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the clipboard and the manual copying fails. be careful with this option, as you may accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use a carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ending of the source files, so you should not use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved when you exit and restore it to the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; Kdiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in curative script will be displayed. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form but would be rendered astert. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will also be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is enabled, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard, then copy the manual copy to the clipboard then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line-end type you prefer for saving. the default value is the generally usual choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Comparing files is trying & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return sign '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others save only a newline character, but then files with different sizes may be displayed in the page-to-side comparison though they are different. when this option is enabled, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are nevertheless displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is deactivated by default. comments in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely looking for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in the default setting. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">This setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also includes conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignoriere C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in the chapter to scan folders and run a merge. see for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Modify the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to stop and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following coding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the top setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding appears a brief note, which is the local coding. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Modify the file codings for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) This option allows you to specify the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded index column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will appear next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just send the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. merge the current file in the merge menu even if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default file name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that matches exactly your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut disturbing parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only at the end of the line. you can write your own pre-processor that matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program it by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient enough.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line levelling to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergulary expression of all characters in one line. the\\ 1 in the encoding string will refer to the found text in the first log pair. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). now, a pre-processing command is needed for line calibration, which removes the automatically generated text: SED's /\\ $\\\\ BAR _\\ BAR _ Date\\\\ $\\\\ Before the $is necessary because $a special character is and the end of the line would mean.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you might like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line calibration. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any hit is replaced by nothing, so it's deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / substitution / SCHALTER 'However, some details are different with perl. where sed\\ (and\\) needs perl only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal pre-processor are retained for viewing and merging. other operations change only the data that the line-off algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal pre-processor, the line-off pre-processor will see the output of the normal pre-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally do not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders using & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes for each object a suggestion for merging; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to run the merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will inform a small message window about the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were then compared.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, it shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu includes two functions All sub-directories can fold and all sub-directories can be opened up and / or fold.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be chosen automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then, folders have the same color. in folders, age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is first green, then yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folders have been specified and when the option directories are synchronized active. then select & use diff3; then select the necessary action, so that after both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and store the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge (unsafe), then explores & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the same date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. As long as such errors are not eliminated, the merging of the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is processed after the other. you status column displays skill when merging was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparative method is selected in the Alignment dialog box, Kdiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, soldered, white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged).</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merges actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not have a destination folder, C is used as a target in the three-folder merge mode, B is chosen as the target and when syncing A and / or B is used as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the target folder should also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select directory merge / continue in the folder menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to just merge the current element, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements. they can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog box appears with the options of passing, simulating and aborting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& nbsp 3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select / continue directory merge again / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved it yet, a corresponding dialog appears.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to choose the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge the merge (F7 key), lets you choose another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been individually compiled, these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them again at the later merge of all entries. even if the merge was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged once again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; Kdiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files which fit on the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other filesystems, a previous score is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the Elementtree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not for potential recursions. a link to a folder which contains a link to itself would result in a final loop and & nbsp; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Executes a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, you may want to compare only the date of change and the file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change of the change date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can be useful, for example, when the change date is lost when copying. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that after both folders are identical. also the results from merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merge the later file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and the extension .original If an old backup file exists with the .orig supplement already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merging whole folder. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view remains visible in the merge of individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch the option directory & text window to switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a file directly without having to start the folder merge. as soon as you save the result, the status will be placed on the server and the file will not be merged once you launch the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status, however, is lost if you re-read the directory again: list -menu: new read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path may be relative and. or.. This is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # contains the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or folder. then always a file is assumed as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permission or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option trust in size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as the differences observer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences viewer and then select In KDEVELOP from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete data files. if it is used as a KPart, it takes & kdiff3; assuming that the input file is a patch file in the unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can click on a patch file and select the Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & nbsp; as Part is executed, it supports only comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot compare) exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can run together like the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have walked this path or get it this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identically; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this legis precaution but this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required was too great so far. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text suddenly lt; No src has left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& nbsp 3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE, please visit the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Um & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the & kdiff3 root folder; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any problems with compiling. if difficulties still occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position resp. replaces the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied to the target folder when merging. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after being merged. (behavior is likely to be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is deactivated. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both within one desktop as well as in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops and applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the blank background of & Kpager, the context menu has only the two entries pager... and Finish. if however, click on an application within & Kpager; click also the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Beyond.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the window manager; it can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">This field lets the & Kpager tell; the numbers of the virtual desktops are displayed. if it is intersected together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st work surface.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the cache mode.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager. otherwise, only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager can be determined: classically, & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, like from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontally, all virtual desktops are shown in horizontal row and vertical right in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager Miniprogram in the Control Panel. it has the advantage that it can be modified in size, display and move windows as symbols or with its content. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click inside & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently it is not possible to change the settings in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or contact your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowtransparentMode and assign value to this. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you need a working installation of the KDE basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor stays on the same spot for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and to emulate pain with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can circumvent the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, power & kmousetool, pause after pressing the mouse button. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the toes with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; click the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When smart shifting is switched on, the shooting range is active (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse happens.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking with mouse button. if this feature is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back causes a double click, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back causes a double click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delay, you can and kde; move to shorten the response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab. there's a slide-down sound buffer, which you adjust to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool, starts at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when you open the dialog. if you have already pressed the button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be switched off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later remove the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse. how that happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be quickly clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. you can easily scrape off the dirt and the dirt with a flat blade or the finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started an imposition, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use with another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but parken the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keystrokes. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent slide but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can deal with it. it is very well possible to select text to copy and paste it into the clipboard, or perform any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will probably only once again cause problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; to use. instead, select text as follows: hold a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while holding the mouse pointer at the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible click. as a result, each time you play kmousetool, the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the shift time starts when moving intelligent. however, you can also use the intelligent move without the audible click of the mouse. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest extension must be installed for & X Window; it should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible click of the mouse is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor waits for a short time. this program was developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome and which causes pain of the mouse buttons.</seg>

<seg id="2599">With a mouse click, select a speaker from the list, and click this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down. the order of the speakers in the list also defines their priority.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running & Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Choose a voice type here, there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl's voice to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="2602">Click Edit. if you click here, the new speaker will appear on the board map Speaker. to change the settings of this speaker click Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Now you can use & ktts; already almost use. go back to the map charts and check if voice output is enabled (KTTSD) is enabled to allow the TTS service from & kde; see. now you can use text card orders to create and manage text orders.</seg>
<seg id="2604">If you have at least one speaker set up, you can start the language output system from & kde. click on the map tab tools to open this map. here you can set some general options.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Mark this check box to activate the TTS System. this starts the KDE TTS service (KTTSD). if this launch succeeds, the card card orders are displayed, and you can create text orders and read. see. remove the mark, KTTSD is stopped and the TTS system from & kde; deactivated.</seg>

<seg id="2612">In & konqueror;, the web browser of & kde;, you can read the text of the displayed page. check first if & tts; then select the text to be read, and select the text editor in the main menu. after a short time, the voice output should start.</seg>
<seg id="2613">It is almost always sensible to select the desired text of a website. you can also skip this step, but then many & HTML; pre-tensioning lines and other invisible marks are also read.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In & kate; the extended text editor of & kde;, you can read the text displayed. first check if & ktts; then select the text to be read, and select the text editor in the main menu. then the voice output should start.</seg>
<seg id="2615">This also works when & kate; in other applications, such as & eg; in & konqueror; or in & Quanta;.</seg>
<seg id="2616">KNotify is the messaging system of & kde; notifying you of events determined by you. you can also read the text of these messages from & ktts; read.</seg>
<seg id="2617">In & Conversation;, the IRC program by & kde;, you can set up different kinds of messages; for example, set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IRC channel where your nickname is present. with & ktts; you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Supports a & kde; -program KNotify, appears a menu entry notification in the menu settings of this program. the possible settings for KNotify differ depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml, which is part of & ktts, is a good example. it removes the Tags br and b from the messages sent by KMail, and also the expression / local / inbox as it can be assumed in most cases as presumed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal working with & ktts, filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited before it is sent to the speech speech tool. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain imperfections of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the "speech" speech "program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The issue of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the edition of the screen reader is read, the retained earnings are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor will be too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a web page, you can be with & kmouth; anyone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you initiate from the card bill is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four orders are processed in queues, with the exception of Screen Readers outputs. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of these reads, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the issue of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. you can specify the parts to be replaced, either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with predefined strings such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way possible.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -reformers use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included & Desktop; are some XSLT files for translation & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With language selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; for example, if you have set a female voice on the flashcard speaker, you can read text of KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text remains unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -alerts to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below. editing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of regular filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not checked and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the information below will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting string inserters, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column consistency and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Erbet. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker speaks one of the languages entered here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the Ctrl; key at the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by comma. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs you get with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers need to be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID kopete-3432 indicates, you may only enter copied.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string release filter will only be applied to the text when all the conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if they match. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string release filter uses regular expressions in the\\ s word\\. the words must be limited by separator characters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual, you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; printouts have been installed, you can use it in the dialogs or edit as help to assemble these terms.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; translation & XML; with the help of XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such deformations. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility needs to be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is reachable via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The filter selection filter allows you to send texts to a certain narrator set up on the card bill, or to a speaker with certain properties. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & Desktop; a text to the filter passes, there is a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker characteristics that the program provides, which sends the text to & dictates; and the characteristics of the spokesman set up on the map card. with the Speaker selection filter, you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help from entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To get faster processing, try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text fulfills the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to match the desired requirements. click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speakers or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, by & kde;, with which programmers can add TTS skills to their applications. applications communicate with KTTSD via & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with the speech synthesizer to be added to KTTSD so & OK; this synthesizer can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a short description of the & kde; -DBus; -Interface of the voice output API by & kde;. the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the kde; accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>
<seg id="2661">Applications require language output services via the & dbus; -interface of & kde; from the program kttsd to the object KSpeech.</seg>

<seg id="2663">There are more commands you can use. for a list of all commands, type</seg>
<seg id="2664">Open two & Console; -windows. start kttsd in a window, then ttsmgr on the other.</seg>
<seg id="2665">None of the above speech synthesizers supports my language. where can I get a synthesizer for my language?</seg>
<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML, but when using the module for festival, web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta, you need to install the (male) voice Rab _ diphone so that SABLE does not work at all. you must then do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages. furthermore, make sure the program xsltproc is installed and can be found over the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain signs or punctuation marks seem to cause mistakes in the synthesizer, so that whole sentences are skipped or only chewing welsh is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First of all, make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be corrected by a string release filter.</seg>

<seg id="2671">The speech synthesizers used by & ktts have their own license, which you can find in the respective documentation or on the relevant websites. there are also voices that own a license.</seg>
<seg id="2672">If you have access to the KDE source code archive, you can download the package kdepartwith & ktts; from it. download in the folder kttsd. in addition, you can find the source code of kdemeanunter ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS also works with any language synthesizer which can be started on the command line in a console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. see also on the page of ktts;, according to information that is not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The speech "speech-patcher" program uses adaptive module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you want to extend and extend for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; -conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later), including the kdelibs packages and the development files for the speech "speech" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for cabling or downloading the tarball currently created every night, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you start typing, check first if speech sound is working correctly with your speech synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts, which uses the speech speech tool. the kttmsg program is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into single sentences. the user can go back to set or paragraph mode, repeat the output or cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to text, it can indicate the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have created a speaker whose language English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen automatically. if you want to know more about it, how & ktts; a speaker chooses, you will look into.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click on Add to Add Agent on the map card, and then insert a speaker in the list or click Edit, the map card box office is displayed. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. details of the modules can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival in PATH is included, you must enter the festival only.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text transferred to festival. in case of voices, the & dictations, this setting is automatically made. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you set the volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some controls and display this grey, the voice you choose doesn't leave these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some votes such as multi-syn voices need several seconds to be uploaded because of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first movement will be synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click Apply to Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the tmgr program window is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the tmgr icon in the system section is visible after the start, but not the program window. click the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ttsmgr is not running yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders in the queue are listed, along with the application that has set the job, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the just edited proposition. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card holder.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can proceed or return in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not each order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK all changes of the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and ttsmgr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click this icon to display the program window again.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click the map audio. see also.</seg>

<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aKode is to be used for the audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are shown in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speaking speed here. 50nbsp;% corresponds to about half and 200ml;% about twice normal speaking speed. to allow these settings to be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the running & Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you need to find out what device works with you. in doubt, select the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this map card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language assignments:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The issue of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. once the screen reader has been read, the retained earnings are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor will be too hot. a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages are the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you have just read a long text on a web page, you can be with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. when both introductory sounds and introductory messages are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map card are valid only for normal text assignments. for messages, warnings and screen readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority message.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & dictfy; to read the Notify messages, start ttsmgr and click notifications. the map notification appears.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to switch the read of & kde; disable notification. if this setting is unchecked, the rest of the settings are grayed out and & ktts; don't read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, alerts with which a sound is played are notifications of & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. when you click the Add button, a dialog appears in which you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & Conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this drop-down box to specify what & Desktop should do if an event occurs. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected user defined text, enter the text you want. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the speaker you want. default select the speaker, which is shown as the top entry in the list on the map card speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a specific event of a specific application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application. as the last option, the action will be used which has been set under standard (all other events).</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All messages for the Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this you can specify the notifications to be read as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to store settings for alerts to a file. use the Upload button to load saved settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Clear. all posts except all notification will be deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, sex of voice and pitch. SSML is part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the Rab _ diphone voice (british male) since this is the standard voice used in the SSML output.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 1005.2%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits detection filters (SDB filter). this can start & dictate text in single sentences. this allows you to start reading faster with the pre-read, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the entire text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limits detection filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add further set limits detection filters, but beginners will get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the selection of speakers is to try out. switch off the choice of speakers and select text to read. switch on the box card orders, which narrator & ktts. switch off the speaker selection, change some properties and check how the speaker chooses. of course, you need to have more than one speaker installed, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& tts; then faster to start reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the speech synthesizer does not support this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal sentence detection filter is set up automatically when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation detection filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator mark (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabulators are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default set delimitation filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -news (knotify), warnings, messages or the issue of Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal sentence detection filter from accidentally, you can paste it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the box card Speaker selection, you can override the Speaker Settings for the application. the map card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card speaker). in other words: no speaker abilities are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of an established speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & dictate; select this speaker. otherwise, select the speaker, which is most likely to match the original character set.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the language properties you want by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature doesn't matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also place multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue, it is always treated as priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is before, if you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default keynote speaker and then use the speaker that is most likely to match the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case there is 0 for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, enter 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & Desktop; it's finished. you probably have to register GStreamer 0.8.x is the command-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstalling GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application. if I get a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA that prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. see the ALSA project (dmix) project at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and usage of & knetworkconf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings over a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way, like other settings from the & knetworkconf, creating a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter will be shown; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu; start.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers need to be fully installed and configured to enable & knetworkconf, the device at all and enables the setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adapting following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network configuration module is loaded when selecting the network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; Index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the choice of hands is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose from, which is best suited for distribution and reloading. by selecting non-re-queries the definition can be determined permanently. next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, change is not possible. in system management mode, you can enter system management mode at the bottom end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The rider network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. the following tasks can be performed by the rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button on the button... Set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at each system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the manual selection manual, the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. the netmask must be specified in the input field network mask.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the appliance list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & Console; you can determine if the address you want is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. switching on an outdated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off as required. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2818">Establishes the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as a standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If more than one network interface is present on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain specification by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine asks http: / / www.eineedomain.org, DNS solves this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the rider's name resolution enables easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. NS records can be rearranged by selecting an entry and listing or downgrading in the list with the buttons pointing or herding in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Servers dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted into the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button. dialog is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of name-known machines describes the hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used with the boot, if no DNS servers are available.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains some known hosts some entries, which & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add new alias will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the Add button. if the known calculator has several alias names, de button Add several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known name from the list and select Edit. edit the Known Calculator dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediate in the system. to activate the changes must be set in a & Console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), when & kde, and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of their distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is not enough; but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended to experienced users, but it is not difficult to compile and compile them. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, and in the second section all of them will be discussed by & knetworkconf; variable configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found any major dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in other networks, on the eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact point that uses a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a section reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own calculator).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content found in the case of active DSL connections than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is referenced by the scripts in SuSEconfig. therefore, another stand can occur as expected.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can start restoring, the files that are to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. it will only recover the selected file or sub-folder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the files listed under Backup Files, only the files in it are backed up, which are on the same file system, such as the folder. folders that are on other filesystems can be stored separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before executing tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>

<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted, and kdat; before the tape is incorporated, the command mts load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, trying & kdat; locking the ejection to the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when resolving & kdat, the tape will be ejected automatically. do not use this option in floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you have to tell & kdat; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The tape-ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar-archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol-files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, try to provide some advanced features to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot shows & ksystemlog; features available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup attempts to open ksystemlog; first, the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not appear to you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not started with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually not found in the folder / var / log, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or for entered strings. add a string to the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be automatically displayed, so that only log lines will be displayed. then a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then compared only with entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. step lines of step errors are shown with a more prominent color as protocol lines of step note. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off a setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identifier (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new upcoming protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find further up-to-date information about the reference sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the program starts when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might try to change a machine to system V init without reinstalling and reformatting.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a sub-folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is named rc.d. dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start when you run the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also create rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. in the beginning area you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. be very careful if you have changed something, then you can repair it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the proper scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no correct files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains a S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I might have a server runlevel running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; also, I could have a user running level, that & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply draw an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevels or change the position within one level by moving somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you drag them into a new range. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with Cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry, press the input key to change the properties dialog. use the tab button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by re-typing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, it will be recovered from / ksysv; it will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the linux single on the LILO prompt and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; intended for running under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplified the configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is related to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save them. you can either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the File save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, the user and the user group list. to edit select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some map cards are only shown when you have set up advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space constraints (quota) for users, a map card will be created on which you can make individual adjustments. further map cards appear, if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card file password management appears, if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd as in BSD -Unixes installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map only appears if for at least one embedded file system constraint (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota user / quota group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the space constraints each data is in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system constraint.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The Groups menu provides information about the group belonging to the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Adding from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO BootManager, add, remove the boot password, remove and change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
